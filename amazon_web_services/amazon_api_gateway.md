### Credential Access: Valid Accounts (T1078)

One of the primary threats to Amazon API Gateway is the compromise of valid accounts, as highlighted in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. If an adversary gains knowledge of API keys or IAM roles that are used to authorize requests to the API Gateway, they can exploit these credentials to perform unauthorized actions. This can include accessing sensitive data, executing malicious requests, or altering configurations. Proper key management, regular rotation of credentials, and implementing least privilege principles are critical mitigations.

### Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)

Amazon API Gateway may serve as an entry point for adversaries exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing APIs. Attackers can identify and exploit unpatched or misconfigured APIs to gain unauthorized access. Common techniques include injection attacks, such as SQL injection or XML external entity (XXE) attacks, which can manipulate the API to divulge data or compromise backend systems. Regular vulnerability assessments and implementing API security best practices are essential defenses.

### Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)

Adversaries may attempt to execute code via Amazon API Gateway by injecting or crafting specific inputs that trigger backend scripts or commands inadvertently exposed through the API. This can lead to remote code execution on backend services. Enforcing strict input validation and sanitation methods, alongside employing Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to detect and block anomalous traffic patterns, helps to mitigate this threat.

### Defense Evasion: Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)

Threat actors might use obfuscation techniques to hide the true intent or content of requests sent through the API Gateway. This can complicate detection efforts and allow malicious payloads to pass through unnoticed. Such techniques may involve encoding data or leveraging uncommon request formats. Utilizing monitoring solutions with pattern recognition capabilities and having a robust logging and alerting process in place can aid in identifying obfuscated threats.

### Credential Access: Brute Force (T1110)

Brute force attacks against Amazon API Gateway can be conducted to gain access to protected resources by guessing API keys, tokens, or user credentials. This type of attack is often automated and can overwhelm the target system. Implementing rate limiting on API requests, using CAPTCHA and multi-factor authentication (MFA), and deploying alert mechanisms for unusual access patterns are essential strategies to counteract brute force attacks.

### Impact: Denial of Service (T1499)

Amazon API Gateway is susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which aim to disrupt the availability of the API by overwhelming it with maliciously high volumes of requests. This can render the API unavailable to legitimate users and services. To mitigate such risks, leverage AWS Shield Advanced for DDoS protection, implement throttling for API requests, and set up alarms to detect and respond to anomalous traffic patterns promptly.

### Discovery: Network Service Scanning (T1046)

Adversaries may attempt network service scanning to discover exposed APIs and related services through Amazon API Gateway. This reconnaissance activity helps attackers identify potential targets and vulnerabilities. Deploying network-level security controls, such as VPC configurations, and ensuring APIs are only exposed as necessary, can limit the effectiveness of such discovery attempts.

### Lateral Movement: Internal Spearphishing (T1534)

While APIs are typically used for machine-to-machine communication, attackers with access to compromised credentials might attempt lateral movement by exploiting internal APIs through spearphishing tactics. By crafting specific API requests to appear legitimate, attackers can navigate internal systems and extract information or escalate privileges. Educating employees about phishing risks and enhancing security controls for internal APIs can help mitigate this threat.
