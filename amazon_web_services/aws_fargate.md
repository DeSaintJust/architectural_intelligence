## Initial Access

### Phishing (T1566)
AWS Fargate environments can be vulnerable to phishing attacks if credentials are obtained through deceptive emails or websites. Attackers may trick users into revealing their AWS Management Console credentials, which could be used to deploy or manipulate Fargate tasks.

### Valid Accounts (T1078)
Using valid AWS IAM credentials is a common approach for adversaries to gain initial access to Fargate. Threat actors may utilize credentials harvested from data breaches or those that have been improperly shared or leaked, allowing unauthorized task modifications or deployments.

## Execution

### Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)
Adversaries might exploit existing command or scripting interfaces within compromised container tasks. This includes executing scripts that alter Fargate task behavior or escalate privileges, impacting container execution flow.

## Persistence

### Container Orchestration Job (T1053.007)
An attacker who gains access to the AWS environment can persist by creating new ECS task definitions or altering existing ones. This ensures that even when tasks terminate, they can be re-launched with malicious code embedded, sustaining a continued foothold.

## Credential Access

### Container API (T1552.007)
AWS Fargate tasks may unintentionally expose secrets through misconfigured APIs or through exploitation of application vulnerabilities. Threat actors can access critical AWS credentials stored in environment variables or metadata services within containers.

## Discovery

### Cloud Service Discovery (T1535)
Attackers may conduct cloud service discovery to map out AWS environments, enumerate ECS clusters, task definitions, and IAM roles associated with Fargate deployments to gather intelligence for further exploitation.

## Lateral Movement

### Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210)
Attackers might exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in Fargate task services or applications running within containers to move laterally across other AWS resources or container workloads, enhancing their access and control over the environment.

## Impact

### Resource Hijacking (T1496)
AWS Fargate resources can be hijacked to run unauthorized compute tasks, such as cryptocurrency mining. This can lead to increased operational costs and potential service disruptions as legitimate workloads are deprived of necessary resources.

### Data Destruction (T1485)
An adversary exploiting Fargate could execute commands designed to destroy data within persistent volumes or connected databases, triggering significant impact by disrupting operations and causing potential data loss.
