### Initial Access: Valid Accounts (T1078)
An adversary may obtain access to AWS CodeArtifact by leveraging compromised credentials. This can occur through phishing, credential stuffing, or password spraying attacks on associated AWS user accounts, enabling unauthorized access to artifact repositories and potentially sensitive information.

### Persistence: Access Token Manipulation (T1134)
Attackers could maintain persistent access to AWS CodeArtifact by manipulating access tokens. Access token stealing or forgery allows adversaries to bypass typical authentication measures, enabling continued access to repositories even if initial access methods are discovered and addressed.

### Privilege Escalation: Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1068)
Adversaries may exploit misconfigurations or inherent vulnerabilities within IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies or roles linked to AWS CodeArtifact to escalate privileges. Incorrectly set permissions might allow users with limited access to gain administrative capabilities over artifact operations.

### Defense Evasion: Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)
To avoid detection, adversaries might obfuscate files or alter metadata within artifacts stored in CodeArtifact. This could include encoding or encrypting malicious code in artifacts to bypass security controls and content inspection mechanisms.

### Credential Access: Credentials in Files (T1552.001)
AWS CodeArtifact configurations or scripts containing hardcoded credentials might be targeted. Adversaries will look for API keys or IAM credentials within configuration files, scripts, or logs that are accessible through their foothold in AWS, using these credentials for further malicious activities.

### Discovery: Cloud Service Discovery (T1526)
An attacker gaining access to a network may perform reconnaissance activities to identify the existence and details of CodeArtifact repositories. This knowledge allows adversaries to better strategize attack methodologies by understanding the architecture and specific repositories of interest.

### Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567.002)
Artifacts, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, could be exfiltrated through web service interactions. Adversaries might use legitimate CodeArtifact APIs to download and exfiltrate sensitive artifacts to external systems over the web.

### Impact: Resource Hijacking (T1496)
Unauthorized access to CodeArtifact might lead to resource hijacking, where adversaries use the platform for illicit purposes like crypto mining or warehousing of illicit digital goods. This impacts service performance and potentially incurs unnecessary costs for legitimate AWS users.
