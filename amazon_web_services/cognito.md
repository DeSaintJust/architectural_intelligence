### Initial Access

**Valid Accounts (T1078):** Threat actors may gain initial access to Amazon Cognito by compromising valid account credentials. This can occur through phishing, password reuse across breached sites, or weak passwords that were not adequately secured with multifactor authentication (MFA). Once an attacker has access to a Cognito user account, they can exploit the associated permissions and potentially escalate privileges further within the AWS environment.

### Persistence

**Account Manipulation (T1098):** Once an attacker has access, they may seek to manipulate user accounts in Amazon Cognito to maintain persistence. This can include creating new user accounts or modifying existing ones, such as adding backdoor user privileges or disabling security measures like MFA to ensure continued access even if the original entry point is discovered and closed.

### Privilege Escalation

**Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1548):** If configured improperly, Cognito can allow for privilege escalation. Attackers exploiting overly broad permissions in role-based access control (RBAC) or exploiting improperly managed Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies can escalate their privileges. For instance, they may be able to move laterally by assuming enhanced roles or escalating their permissions within a federated identity provider setup.

### Defense Evasion

**Impair Defenses (T1562):** Attackers might attempt to evade detection by impairing Amazon Cognito's logging and monitoring capabilities. Techniques can include disabling Cognito logging or manipulating logs to hide their malicious activity. This could also involve altering the notification settings to prevent alerting of security teams or exploiting service misconfigurations to avoid audits.

### Credential Access

**Brute Force (T1110):** Credential stuffing and brute force attacks are common threats to Amazon Cognito. Attackers automate the process of submitting many username and password combinations in hopes of guessing correct credentials, often leveraging credentials from previous data breaches. Without account lockout mechanisms or CAPTCHA-enabled workflows, this technique can be a potent method for accessing protected accounts.

### Discovery

**Cloud Infrastructure Discovery (T1580):** Attackers may attempt to gather information about Amazon Cognito configuration and associated resources. They might query AWS to enumerate the user pools and identity pools, find misconfigurations, or probe for auxiliary data that can inform further attacks. This reconnaissance can reveal API configurations, federated identity settings, and linked AWS services that could be leveraged for deeper penetration.

### Impact

**Data Manipulation (T1565):** Threat actors with access to Cognito can manipulate user data, either by altering user attributes or modifying identity pool data. This manipulation can support further social engineering attacks, privacy violations, or disrupt normal service operations by impacting application behavior that depends on user data for functionality.
