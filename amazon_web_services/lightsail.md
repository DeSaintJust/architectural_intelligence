#### Initial Access

**Drive-by Compromise (T1189):** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in web applications running on Amazon Lightsail instances, using drive-by downloads to gain initial access. By enticing a user to visit a malicious site, the attacker can quietly download and execute malware, potentially compromising the server or connected systems.

**Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190):** Adversaries may target vulnerabilities in Lightsail-hosted applications to gain unauthorized access. This might involve exploiting weak configurations or unpatched software to execute arbitrary code and gain initial footholds.

#### Execution

**Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059):** Attackers may abuse available command-line interfaces on Lightsail instances to execute scripts and commands that further their attack objectives, such as establishing persistence, escalating privileges, or exfiltrating data.

#### Persistence

**Account Manipulation (T1098):** Once inside, adversaries might create new accounts or modify existing ones on Lightsail to maintain persistent access. By leveraging compromised credentials, they can repeatedly access the environment even if the initial vulnerability is mitigated.

#### Privilege Escalation

**Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068):** Attackers might exploit both known and zero-day vulnerabilities in the operating system or applications hosted on Lightsail to elevate their privileges from those of a normal user to root or administrator.

#### Defense Evasion

**Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027):** Malicious actors may store or execute obfuscated code on Lightsail instances to avoid detection by common security tools. This may include encoding scripts or packing binaries to hide malicious intentions.

#### Credential Access

**Credential Dumping (T1003):** Attackers might attempt to extract passwords stored in Lightsail instances' memory or gather credential files from the disk, allowing them to move laterally within a compromised environment or access additional accounts or services.

#### Discovery

**Network Service Scanning (T1046):** An adversary could scan the network for open ports and services on Amazon Lightsail instances. By identifying exposed services, they can plan further exploit attempts or identify weaknesses in the security posture.

#### Lateral Movement

**Remote Services (T1021):** Compromised credentials can be used to access other Lightsail instances or AWS services via SSH or API calls, enabling attackers to move within the AWS environment to achieve broader objectives.

#### Collection

**Data from Local System (T1005):** Cybercriminals might access and collect sensitive data stored locally on Lightsail instances. This includes databases, logs, and configuration files containing valuable information.

#### Exfiltration

**Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567):** Data extracted from Lightsail instances may be exfiltrated using web protocols to avoid detection. Attackers can leverage HTTP(S) requests to send data to remote web servers under their control.

#### Impact

**Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486):** Ransomware attacks on Lightsail instances could encrypt critical data, rendering applications unusable and disrupting business operations. This often involves demanding a ransom for decryption keys to restore access.
