### Initial Access - Valid Accounts (T1078)
Threat actors may attempt to gain initial access to Amazon RDS by leveraging compromised credentials. This could involve phishing attacks, social engineering tactics, or brute-force attacks that aim to acquire valid AWS IAM credentials with permissions to access and manage RDS instances. Once such access is obtained, adversaries can execute queries against databases or alter configurations to further their objectives.

### Execution - Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203)
Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in database client applications or directly within the RDS service itself. This can involve sending malformed requests to the database engine to execute arbitrary code, using injection techniques like SQL injection, or exploiting misconfigurations that allow unauthorized code execution. Such exploitation can enable attackers to perform unauthorized operations or steal data.

### Persistence - External Remote Services (T1133)
To maintain persistent access to RDS, adversaries might leverage external remote services like VPNs and web applications connected to the RDS. By setting up continuous connections or creating backdoor accounts, attackers can ensure prolonged access even if initial access methods are mitigated. Persistent access allows for long-term espionage or repeated data extraction.

### Privilege Escalation - Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1548)
Privilege escalation might be attempted by exploiting misconfigured IAM policies or acquiring additional access rights within the AWS infrastructure. Attackers might manipulate role-based access control to elevate their privileges, gaining higher-level access to RDS management capabilities or sensitive data stored in the databases.

### Defense Evasion - User Execution (T1204)
Attackers may attempt to evade detection by masquerading as legitimate users through stolen credentials. By using legitimate user accounts, especially those with minimal audit logging, adversaries can operate stealthily, reducing the likelihood of triggering security alerts. 

### Credential Access - Unsecured Credentials (T1552)
Unsecured credentials pose a notable threat to RDS. This includes hardcoded credentials in application code, exposed API keys in public GitHub repositories, or stolen credentials through other means such as phishing or keylogging. With these credentials, attackers can authenticate directly into RDS instances and conduct unauthorized operations.

### Discovery - Cloud Service Discovery (T1526)
Adversaries might perform cloud service discovery to identify RDS instances and gather information about the database environment, such as DB engine type, version, security group configurations, and more. This information can be leveraged to craft targeted attacks or to exploit known vulnerabilities specific to the identified infrastructure.

### Lateral Movement - Cloud Services (T1567)
Once an adversary gains access to RDS, they might pivot to other cloud services by exploiting IAM roles attached to the database instance or exploiting network configurations. This can allow an attacker to move laterally within the AWS environment, accessing additional data or services and broadening the attack surface.

### Collection - Data from Information Repositories (T1213)
An attacker may target data stored within RDS to exfiltrate sensitive information. By executing SQL queries, they can extract valuable data such as personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property, or confidential business data. Compromised databases are often key targets due to the wealth of information they contain.

### Exfiltration - Transfer Data to Cloud Account (T1537)
Exfiltration of data can be achieved by transferring dataset copies from the RDS to an external cloud account controlled by the attacker. Leveraging cloud-native data export functionalities or transferring data directly over the network can be avenues for exfiltrating sensitive datasets without detection.

### Impact - Data Manipulation (T1565)
Attackers might alter data in RDS instances to disrupt operations, degrade service quality, or manipulate the integrity of business processes. This could involve directly modifying database records, injecting false data, deleting critical entries, or otherwise tampering with the dataset to negatively impact an organization.
