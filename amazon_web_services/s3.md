**Initial Access - Initial Access via Cloud Entry Points (T1566.001):** Attackers may exploit public-facing cloud entry points such as AWS S3 buckets if incorrectly configured to allow public access. Such configurations can be leveraged to gain initial access, allowing attackers to enumerate and interact with the bucket contents.

**Execution - Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203):** Malicious actors may execute scripts or binaries stored in S3 buckets by exploiting vulnerable client software that accesses the S3 bucket content. If an organization's software automatically executes files stored in S3, attackers may deliver and trigger malicious code execution.

**Persistence - Cloud VM Metadata API (T1552.005):** While this technique specifically targets virtual machines, persistence in the context of S3 can be achieved by manipulating IAM roles tied to AWS services interacting with S3. By gaining access through improperly secured API endpoints or metadata, attackers can maintain long-term access to bucket data.

**Credential Access - Access Token Manipulation (T1114.002):** Attackers may access AWS S3 by capturing and reusing session tokens or IAM access keys found in improperly secured services or applications. They might also target temporary credentials available through IAM roles that are assumed by services operating within AWS, to access S3 buckets.

**Discovery - Cloud Service Discovery (T1580):** Attackers typically aim to discover information about AWS cloud services, including the enumeration of S3 bucket names and their associated metadata. Public bucket names can also be guessed or exposed, leading attackers to discover potentially sensitive data.

**Defense Evasion - Permission Groups Discovery (T1069.003):** Threat actors may seek to identify and understand the IAM policies attached to S3 buckets. By understanding these policies, they can gauge what actions will trigger alerts or logs, allowing them to plan actions that evade detection.

**Collection - Data from Cloud Storage Object (T1530):** S3 buckets are commonly targeted for the collection of sensitive data. Attackers can directly download objects from buckets that are left public or have weak access controls. They may utilize found credentials to access private bucket contents as well.

**Exfiltration - Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567.003):** Data exfiltration can be carried out by transferring sensitive information from S3 to external destinations over web services. Attackers may script such data movements, leveraging AWS APIs or SDKs, potentially disguising the exfiltration as normal API traffic.

**Impact - Data Destruction (T1485):** Malicious actors with write permissions to an S3 bucket may delete or overwrite sensitive data. This impact technique involves causing loss or destruction of data stored in the cloud, which could disrupt operations or incur financial losses.

**Impact - Resource Hijacking (T1496):** Attackers may inject scripts into S3 buckets utilized for hosting web applications, causing these resources to consume excess bandwidth or compute power to serve malicious purposes, such as participating in larger attack infrastructures, potentially leading to increased operational costs.
