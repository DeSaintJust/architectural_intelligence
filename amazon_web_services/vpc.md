### Initial Access
One of the primary threats to an AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is unauthorized access, which can occur through exposed APIs. Threat actors may exploit exposed AWS Management APIs to gain initial access to the VPC, leveraging credentials obtained through phishing or other deceptive means. This corresponds with MITRE ATT&CK's T1078 (Valid Accounts) and its sub-technique T1078.004 (Cloud Accounts), where an adversary uses compromised credentials to interact with cloud services.

### Execution
Once inside a VPC, attackers can execute malicious scripts or commands using available cloud services. The technique T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) is relevant when attackers utilize scripting capabilities provided by services like AWS Lambda or EC2 User Data to execute payloads that further their goals within the VPC environment.

### Persistence
Maintaining access often involves creating backdoors or exploiting IAM roles that allow for long-term access. Techniques such as T1078 (Valid Accounts) are utilized when malicious actors assign themselves roles or spawn additional services to ensure they retain access, even if their initial point of entry is closed.

### Privilege Escalation
Attackers could exploit misconfigured permissions and IAM roles to escalate their privileges within a VPC. This aligns with T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation), where vulnerabilities in IAM policies are leveraged to gain elevated privileges that enable further action within the AWS environment.

### Defense Evasion
To evade detection, adversaries may use technique T1070.004 (File Deletion) to clear logs and hide their tracks by deleting or altering AWS CloudTrail logs, which are critical for monitoring and auditing activities in AWS environments. This helps in obscuring malicious activity and avoiding visibility to security monitors.

### Credential Access
Attackers often seek to harvest AWS credentials directly from instances within the VPC. With the use of T1552.001 (Credentials in Files), attackers look for stored keys in configuration files or environment variables, allowing them to expand their influence across the AWS infrastructure.

### Discovery
To gather valuable information about the VPC environment, attackers employ techniques such as T1580 (Cloud Infrastructure Discovery). This involves API calls to enumerate resources, configurations, and permissions within the VPC, giving attackers insights into the architecture and potential misconfigurations that they can exploit.

### Lateral Movement
Threat actors move laterally within the VPC by exploiting interconnected services and misconfigured security settings. T1021 (Remote Services) becomes relevant when adversaries pivot through internal VPC resources using compromised credentials, often hopping between EC2 instances to expand control or exfiltrate data.

### Collection
Data exfiltration or collection of sensitive information can occur through S3 (Simple Storage Service) buckets, as attackers exploit T1074.002 (Data Staged: Cloud Storage). Misconfigured bucket permissions allow adversaries to copy or download sensitive data, which can then be extracted for malicious purposes.

### Exfiltration
Data can be exfiltrated via outbound traffic through various means, aligning with T1048 (Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol). For example, an attacker could leverage cloud services communications to smuggle data out of the VPC, bypassing traditional defenses by using standard cloud service protocols to evade detection.

### Impact
Finally, attackers may seek to disrupt operations or cause damage through techniques like T1486 (Data Encrypted for Impact), where they utilize ransomware to encrypt data within the VPC. This impacts data availability and disrupts normal business operations, demanding ransom for decryption keys.
