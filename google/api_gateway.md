### Credential Access: Valid Accounts (T1078)
Attackers may gain access to GCP API Gateway by acquiring valid credentials. This can be achieved through methods like phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting misconfigured access controls. Once attackers have obtained legitimate account credentials, they can interact with the API Gateway to manipulate API traffic, extract sensitive data, or change configurations.

### Persistence: Create or Modify Cloud Accounts (T1098.001)
Adversaries may create new cloud accounts with high privileges or modify existing user roles to maintain long-term access to the API Gateway. By having persistent access, attackers can ensure continued disruption or surveillance of API activities, even if initial intrusion methods are detected and remediated.

### Lateral Movement: Internal Spearphishing (T1534)
Internal spearphishing attacks could be launched to move laterally towards API Gateway. This technique involves crafting specific phishing content aimed at users with access to the API Gateway to execute unauthorized modifications or extract vital data, thereby bypassing standard peripheral security measures.

### Discovery: Cloud Service Discovery (T1526)
Threat actors may perform cloud service discovery to enumerate GCP services, including API Gateway configurations and routines. By gaining information about exposed APIs, permissions, and roles, adversaries can build a comprehensive map of the service for further attacks, including identifying weak points to exploit.

### Collection: Data from Cloud Storage Object (T1530)
Adversaries might target data stored within cloud services accessible via the API Gateway. Once access is gained, attackers can collect sensitive data in transit or data logs that are part of the API's operations, leading to data leaks or misuse of private information.

### Impact: Endpoint Denial of Service (T1499.002)
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack on the API Gateway could cause service disruptions. Attackers may send a flood of malformed or excessive requests, overwhelming the gateway and preventing legitimate API requests from being processed. This affects service availability and may cause financial and reputational damage.

### Defense Evasion: Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure (T1578.003)
In an effort to evade defenses, attackers could modify cloud infrastructure settings associated with the API Gateway. This might include altering API endpoints, modifying network routes, or changing logging settings to mask their activity, making detection challenging for security teams monitoring the environment.

### Privilege Escalation: Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1548)
To escalate privileges, adversaries may exploit API Gateway's misconfigured Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies or insufficient access controls. By doing so, they can gain higher-level permissions than initially intended, allowing them to execute unauthorized actions or access sensitive parts of the infrastructure.

### Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol (T1071)
Attackers may utilize legitimate application layer protocols (such as HTTPS) to send commands to the API Gateway. By disguising their malicious traffic within normal API requests, they can maintain a covert command and control channel that leverages the appearance of legitimate service communications.
