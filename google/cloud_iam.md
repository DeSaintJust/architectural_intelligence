**T1078 - Valid Accounts:** Adversaries may leverage compromised user credentials to access Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM). Once in possession of valid credentials, attackers can escalate their privileges or maintain persistent access without triggering standard anomaly detection mechanisms. They might exploit stolen credentials through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, allowing them to authenticate as legitimate users.

**T1556 - Modify Authentication Process:** Attackers can compromise the authentication process itself by altering or exploiting IAM policies or permissions in GCP. This could include manipulating policies to gain higher privileges, creating backdoor users or service accounts, or changing security settings to disable multi-factor authentication requirements, making the environment more susceptible to unauthorized access.

**T1580 - Cloud Infrastructure Discovery:** Once access is gained, attackers may enumerate IAM roles and permissions to understand the cloud environment's layout and security posture. They may list users, roles, groups, and associated permissions to identify targets for further exploitation, allowing them to tailor their attacks more effectively to the discovered configuration and access control schemes.

**T1530 - Data from Cloud Storage Object:** If attackers gain access to GCP IAM permissions, they may be able to access sensitive data stored in cloud storage objects, such as Google Cloud Storage buckets. By understanding and exploiting the permissions granted to users or service accounts, adversaries could exfiltrate sensitive data unnoticed if audit logging and monitoring are insufficient.

**T1609 - Container Administration Command:** Upon gaining IAM credentials that grant access to GCP services, adversaries might execute administration commands on container services such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This activity could include deploying malicious containers or altering existing workloads to provide backdoor access, exfiltrate data, or conduct further reconnaissance.

**T1197 - BITS Jobs:** An advanced persistent threat could abuse Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) jobs in the context of workloads managed through GCP IAM. Although more relevant in a hybrid cloud context, exploiting BITS jobs through IAM roles can enable stealthy transfer of data, avoid detection, and maintain persistent footholds in the cloud infrastructure.

**T1098 - Account Manipulation:** Attackers may modify IAM accounts by adding, deleting, or altering roles and permissions to maintain access or disrupt operations. For example, they could escalate to admin roles, remove critical personnel from privileged roles, or create unrecognized shadow accounts to ensure uninterrupted access to the GCP resources.

**T1070 - Indicator Removal on Host:** Adversaries with sufficient IAM privileges might disable or tamper with logging and monitoring services in GCP. This action is aimed at concealing their tracks and delaying detection by security operations teams, often through modifying IAM roles with logging permissions or directly altering logging configurations.

**T1557 - Adversary-in-the-Middle:** Attackers exploiting IAM roles might set up proxy or intermediary services that intercept GCP traffic. Using permissions granted by compromised IAM roles, they could alter network routes or DNS settings to position themselves between legitimate users and their services, capturing sensitive information or injecting malicious payloads.
