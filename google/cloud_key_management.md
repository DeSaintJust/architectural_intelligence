### T1078.004 - Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts  
Threat actors may attempt to gain access to GCP Cloud Key Management by leveraging valid cloud account credentials that have been obtained through phishing, credential stuffing, brute force attacks, or from previous compromises. Once authenticated, an attacker could manage, export, or delete cryptographic keys, potentially resulting in unauthorized access to encrypted data or service disruptions.

### T1530 - Data from Cloud Storage Object  
Adversaries could exploit misconfigured permissions for GCP Cloud Key Management or related services, accessing cryptographic keys stored within cloud environments. Improper access controls may allow attackers to read, utilize, or export keys without detection, leading to potential data exposure, privilege escalation, or secured service manipulation.

### T1531 - Account Access Removal  
An attacker with substantial privileges may remove access to legitimate users by modifying IAM permissions on Cloud Key Management. By doing so, they could disrupt operations, block recovery actions, or ensure persistent access to encrypted resources. Modifying or revoking access can be a powerful denial of service tool often used to obfuscate malicious activities in the cloud environment.

### T1552.001 - Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files  
GCP Cloud Key Management credentials can be inadvertently exposed through improperly secured files, such as scripts, logs, or code repositories. Threat actors may scan for these unsecured credentials and use them to access or manipulate cryptographic keys. Properly securing credentials, employing minimal privileges, and conducting regular audits can mitigate this threat.

### T1562.001 - Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools  
Adversaries might attempt to disable or alter logging and monitoring functions within GCP services, including those used to track actions within Cloud Key Management. Such modifications would hinder the detection of unauthorized access or the monitoring of key management activities, allowing malicious actions to proceed without immediate notice.

### T1578.002 - Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure: Remove Service  
Attackers with sufficient access could remove instances or services that rely on keys managed by Cloud Key Management. This can hinder the availability of the services and impact the encrypted data associated with them. Moreover, service removal could be a diversion tactic to mask other malicious actions within the GCP environment.

### T1580 - Cloud Infrastructure Discovery  
Conducting a discovery of cloud infrastructure, adversaries may target Cloud Key Management by exploring the configuration and deployment settings in GCP, looking for misconfigurations, exposed IAM permissions, or logs detailing key usage. Upon identifying weaknesses, they may attempt exploitation or pivot to other related cloud resources to further their objectives.
