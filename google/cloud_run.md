**Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application**  
Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in applications deployed on GCP Cloud Run to gain initial access. This technique involves identifying and leveraging weaknesses in the application code, such as insufficient input validation or unpatched software libraries, allowing unauthorized entry to execute malicious payloads or gain unauthorized data access.

**Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter**  
Once initial access is gained, adversaries might use command and scripting interpreters such as shell scripts within a compromised container in Cloud Run. This could involve executing scripts to download additional malware or automate malicious tasks, leveraging Cloud Run's ability to execute code in response to HTTPS requests.

**Persistence: Container/Image Configuration Modification**  
Adversaries might manipulate the configuration of containers or images to achieve persistence within GCP Cloud Run environments. This could involve altering startup scripts, modifying environment variables, or embedding malicious scripts within container images that are regularly deployed or restarted, maintaining a foothold over time.

**Privilege Escalation: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**  
Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities within the platform or the application code to escalate privileges. This could allow them to execute commands with higher permissions than initially authorized, enabling broader access to application functionality, sensitive data, or even other GCP services.

**Defense Evasion: Obfuscated Files or Information**  
To avoid detection, attackers may obfuscate payloads or other malicious artifacts within container images on Cloud Run. This can involve using techniques like encoding or encrypting payloads, making binary data difficult to comprehend, or embedding lines in configurations and scripts that evade forensic analysis.

**Credential Access: Cloud Credentials**  
Adversaries might seek to capture cloud credentials from within GCP Cloud Run environments. This can be done by exploiting insufficiently protected environment variables or configurations to harvest keys, tokens, or other sensitive information used to authenticate against other GCP services and resources.

**Discovery: Cloud Service Discovery**  
Threat actors may perform cloud service discovery by examining the roles and permissions available to the compromised container. They may query metadata services, inspect environment variables, or check configuration details to gather information about the cloud architecture, enabling further planning and attacks.

**Collection: Data from Configuration Repository**  
Attackers could access data from configuration repositories linked to GCP Cloud Run. This can include databases or storage services containing configuration secrets, API keys, and other sensitive information, which, if extracted, could be used to escalate attacks or access further resources within the cloud environment.

**Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service**  
GCP Cloud Run containers compromised by attackers might be used to exfiltrate data over web services. HTTP-based communications can be utilized to send data extracted from the cloud environment to an external server, often masked as legitimate traffic to avoid detection by monitoring systems.

**Impact: Resource Hijacking**  
Adversaries might exploit GCP Cloud Run to hijack resources for purposes such as cryptocurrency mining. By deploying unauthorized workloads within the compromised instance, attackers can consume CPU and memory resources, impacting the availability and performance of legitimate applications and potentially incurring financial costs for the cloud account owner.
