## Initial Access

### Valid Accounts (T1078)
Threat actors may leverage valid user credentials to gain unauthorized access to Databricks on GCP. These credentials can be obtained through phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting reused passwords. Once inside, attackers can move laterally, access sensitive data, and launch further attacks on the cloud environment.

## Execution

### Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)
Attackers can utilize built-in scripting languages, such as Python or Scala in Databricks notebooks, to execute malicious commands. This technique allows adversaries to manipulate data, execute unauthorized code, or deploy malware within the Databricks environment, potentially compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the data.

## Persistence

### Cloud Account (T1098)
Adversaries may create new cloud accounts or modify existing ones to maintain persistent access to GCP Databricks. By elevating privileges or creating backdoor access, attackers can ensure their continued presence in the environment, making it difficult for defenders to eradicate the threat completely.

## Privilege Escalation

### Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068)
Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities within the GCP Databricks infrastructure or the Databricks platform itself to gain elevated privileges. Successful exploitation allows adversaries to perform high-privilege operations, access sensitive data, and disable security controls.

## Defense Evasion

### Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)
To evade detection, attackers may use obfuscation techniques such as encoding, encryption, or hiding malicious payloads within seemingly benign scripts or notebooks. These tactics make it challenging for security tools to detect and analyze the malicious activity within the Databricks environment.

## Credential Access

### Credential Dumping (T1003)
Adversaries might attempt to extract credentials from Databricks clusters by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. They could access sensitive credentials for GCP services or Databricks accounts, allowing them to further infiltrate and manipulate the cloud environment.

## Discovery

### Cloud Service Discovery (T1526)
Attackers can use built-in cloud APIs or interfaces to enumerate and gather information about the Databricks environment. This includes discovering storage buckets, virtual machine instances, and network configurations, which helps them tailor subsequent stages of their attack.

## Lateral Movement

### Remote Services (T1021)
Adversaries may exploit remote services like SSH or API endpoints to move laterally within the GCP Databricks environment. By accessing interconnected resources and services, attackers can expand their footprint and potentially access sensitive data in other parts of the cloud infrastructure.

## Collection

### Data from Information Repositories (T1213)
Once inside the environment, attackers may target data stored within Databricks workspaces or linked storage services. By gathering sensitive datasets or intellectual property, they can extract valuable information which might be used for further corporate espionage or data leaks.

## Exfiltration

### Transfer Data to Cloud Account (T1567)
Threat actors may attempt to exfiltrate sensitive data from Databricks by transferring it to an external cloud account under their control. This can be done using cloud APIs or exporting features within Databricks, allowing adversaries to access the stolen data from another location.

## Impact

### Data Destruction (T1485)
Attackers might launch destructive operations within Databricks environments, aiming to delete or corrupt critical datasets. Such actions can severely impact businesses relying on this data for analytics and decision-making, leading to financial and reputational losses.
