### Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)

Applications running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) integrated with Datadog may expose vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries to gain initial access. This can occur if there are security flaws in the web applications, APIs, or other services exposed publicly. An attacker may use automated tools to discover these vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or command injection, to compromise the application and subsequently pivot to Datadog for unauthorized access to system metrics and logs.

### Credential Access: Valid Accounts (T1078)

Attackers might attempt to obtain valid credentials to access GCP or Datadog by exploiting weak passwords, credential reuse, or social engineering attacks like phishing. Once obtained, they can authenticate against Datadog services to view sensitive monitoring data, manipulate dashboards, or create metrics that could obfuscate reconnaissance activities or further attacks.

### Persistence: Account Manipulation (T1098)

An adversary with sufficient privileges might create, manipulate, or delete accounts within GCP or Datadog to establish persistence. This may include creating service accounts with minimal monitoring to go unnoticed or altering role permissions to maintain access over a longer term without detection.

### Privilege Escalation: Abusing Elevation Control Mechanisms (T1078.003)

Exploiting improperly configured IAM policies or leveraging released GCP roles with excessive permissions can enable attackers to escalate privileges. By gaining higher-level permissions, they could alter Datadog configurations, disable alerts, or access sensitive data aggregates for further exploitation.

### Defense Evasion: Disable Security Tools (T1562.001)

An attacker could target and disable security monitoring tools or alerting features enabled within Datadog. This action might include terminating agent processes, preventing logs from reaching DataDog, or modifying alert thresholds and queries to avoid detection of malicious activities.

### Discovery: Cloud Service Discovery (T1526)

Adversaries may perform cloud service discovery by collecting environment data such as finding associated IAM roles, understanding the architecture of Datadog configurations, or using GCP services maps to identify potential targets. This information can be used to fine-tune attacks and navigate through the cloud environment more effectively.

### Collection: Data from Cloud Storage Object (T1530)

If GCP logs or system metrics collected and stored are not properly secured, attackers might access these storage buckets directly. Misconfigured permissions or lack of encryption could expose sensitive Datadog log data which can be used to fingerprint systems, uncover vulnerabilities, or facilitate lateral movement within the cloud infrastructure.

### Impact: Data Manipulation (T1565)

Adversaries with access to Datadog might alter data to mislead analysis, trigger false alerts, or hide their tracks. This can involve changing metric values, manipulating dashboards to trigger incorrect operational responses, or creating noise that obscures legitimate alert patterns, thus impacting the decision-making process of the security or operations team.

### Exfiltration: Exfiltration over Alternative Protocol (T1048)

Attackers could exfiltrate data from GCP and Datadog over non-standard protocols to evade network-based defenses. By using covert channels or leveraging services like DNS tunneling, adversaries might extract sensitive information without triggering standard alerts or detection mechanisms put in place to monitor network activities.
