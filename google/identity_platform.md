## Initial Access

### T1078 - Valid Accounts
Attackers may attempt to gain access to GCP Identity Platform through the use of valid credentials. Credential theft can be achieved through phishing attacks, keylogging, or purchasing credentials from illicit sources. Once attackers have valid account details, they can authenticate and interact with GCP services as a legitimate user, bypassing many security detection measures.

## Execution

### T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution
An adversary might exploit vulnerabilities within the applications that interface with the GCP Identity Platform. For instance, targeting web applications that improperly handle user authentication tokens can allow adversaries to execute malicious code, enabling unauthorized actions within the GCP environment.

## Persistence

### T1509 - Infrastructure as Code
Attackers may alter the configurations of Identity Platform-managed resources through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform. By manipulating IaC templates, adversaries can introduce backdoors or malicious settings that provide persistent access to the compromised environment.

## Privilege Escalation

### T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
An attacker could leverage vulnerabilities in GCP services or APIs to escalate their privileges. By gaining administrative privileges on the Identity Platform, attackers can manipulate user roles and permissions, significantly increasing the potential impact of their malicious activities.

## Defense Evasion

### T1070 - Indicator Removal
Adversaries may clear log entries or manipulate logs within the GCP environment to cover their tracks following unauthorized activities. Effective use of the GCP Logging and Monitoring services to identify such actions requires vigilance and secure audit log preservation.

## Credential Access

### T1212 - Exploitation for Credential Access
Attackers may exploit weaknesses in applications or systems connected to the GCP Identity Platform to harvest user credentials. Vulnerabilities like insecure direct object references and poorly implemented session management can lead to unauthorized access to authentication details.

## Discovery

### T1538 - Cloud Service Discovery
Once inside the environment, attackers may perform reconnaissance to discover GCP services and resources associated with the Identity Platform. They often search through configuration files and cloud-specific metadata to find information that could aid in further exploitation.

## Lateral Movement

### T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services
Adversaries may use compromised credentials or stolen authentication tokens to access other GCP services through legitimate APIs. By pivoting across various services, attackers can spread their activity across the cloud environment, making detection and mitigation more challenging.

## Collection

### T1119 - Automated Collection
Automated tools can be employed by attackers to continuously harvest sensitive information from GCP services linked to the Identity Platform. This can include user data, token information, and other sensitive credentials that might be stored within the GCP environment.

## Command and Control

### T1132 - Data Encoding
Adversaries might use data encoding techniques to exfiltrate data from the GCP Identity Platform covertly. By disguising the data as they transfer it over the network, attackers can obfuscate their actions, making detection by security tools more difficult.

## Exfiltration

### T1020 - Automated Exfiltration
Attackers can use scripted processes to exfiltrate large volumes of data from GCP. This can involve using cloud storage services and public APIs to move data outside of the GCP environment, targeting customer data or system configurations managed by the Identity Platform.

## Impact

### T1531 - Account Access Removal
Once access is gained and objectives are achieved, an attacker may remove access, effectively locking out legitimate users from their GCP Identity Platform resources. This can be achieved by altering or deleting user accounts and roles, leading to disruption in service availability and a potential need for disaster recovery procedures.
