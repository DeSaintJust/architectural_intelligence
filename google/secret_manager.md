### Credential Access: Unsecured Credentials (T1552.001)

One of the primary threats to GCP Secret Manager is the storage or exposure of unsecured credentials in code repositories, configuration files, or logs. Attackers often search for exposed secrets in public repositories on platforms like GitHub, potentially gaining access to sensitive information stored in the Secret Manager. Mitigation strategies include using secret scanning tools to identify and remove credentials from codebases and ensuring sensitive information is only accessed through environment variables or secure storage solutions.

### Lateral Movement: Valid Accounts (T1078)

Compromised or mismanaged credentials to access GCP accounts can enable attackers to perform lateral movement within the cloud environment. If an attacker gains access to an account with permissions to read or modify secrets in the Secret Manager, they could exfiltrate sensitive data or plant malicious configurations. Implementing strong authentication mechanisms, like multi-factor authentication (MFA), and ensuring least privilege access to secrets can help mitigate this risk.

### Discovery: Cloud Service Discovery (T1580)

Attackers might engage in cloud service discovery to enumerate and map out the services used within a GCP environment, including Secret Manager. By leveraging APIs or poorly configured IAM policies, adversaries can obtain sensitive information about secret names and configurations. To counteract cloud service discovery threats, it's vital to ensure proper IAM configurations and regularly audit access permissions to minimize exposure.

### Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses (T1562)

Attackers may attempt to impair logging and monitoring defenses to prevent detection of unauthorized access to GCP Secret Manager. This could involve disabling audit logs or modifying alerting mechanisms to cover their tracks. GCP's Cloud Audit Logs should be configured to track access and modifications, while regular audits and alert reviews can help detect and respond to suspicious activities promptly.

### Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567)

After accessing secrets stored in Secret Manager, attackers may exfiltrate this information over web services to external locations. This technique involves using encrypted protocols to bypass network monitoring and evade detection. Implementing data loss prevention (DLP) policies, network monitoring for suspicious outbound traffic, and anomaly detection systems can help identify and block data exfiltration attempts.

### Initial Access: Supply Chain Compromise (T1195)

A supply chain compromise poses a significant risk to GCP Secret Manager. If an attacker manages to insert malicious code or backdoors into third-party components that interact with the Secret Manager, they can gain unauthorized access to secrets. To mitigate this risk, ensuring the supply chain's integrity through rigorous vetting and monitoring of third-party dependencies, and using signed dependencies wherever possible, is crucial.

### Persistence: Account Manipulation (T1098)

Attackers may attempt to achieve persistence by manipulating account privileges or roles within GCP to maintain access to the Secret Manager. By creating rogue accounts or elevating privileges, they can secure ongoing access to secrets. Regularly reviewing and managing IAM roles, removing unnecessary accounts, and employing automated tooling to detect deviations from baseline account states are effective countermeasures against this technique.
