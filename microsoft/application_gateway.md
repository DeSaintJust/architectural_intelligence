### Credential Access - Valid Accounts (T1078)

Attackers can leverage stolen or compromised credentials to gain unauthorized access to the Azure Application Gateway. Once inside, they might extract sensitive configurations and manipulate settings. This threat can manifest as an insider threat or through phishing techniques that capture valid account details. Mitigation can involve employing multi-factor authentication and regularly reviewing access logs to detect anomalous activities.

### Persistence - Implantation of Malicious Entities (T1543)

Threat actors may attempt to maintain persistent access to Azure environments by implanting malicious configurations within the Application Gateway. By altering routing rules or deploying rogue SSL certificates, attackers can exfiltrate or manipulate traffic. It is crucial to regularly audit configurations and enforce role-based access controls to limit the ability to modify gateway settings.

### Defense Evasion - Disable Security Tools (T1562)

An adversary might disable or bypass security settings within the Application Gateway to evade detection. This can include altering firewall policies or removing security extensions that provide protection against Layer 7 attacks. Log monitoring and enabling alerts for configuration changes are vital in detecting such suspicious activities promptly.

### Discovery - Cloud Services Discovery (T1526)

Attackers may perform cloud service discovery to gather information about deployed Azure services, including the Application Gateway. They gain insights into the architecture and configurations that could be further exploited. Utilizing audit logs and access restrictions can deter unauthorized discovery and potential reconnaissance activities.

### Lateral Movement - Remote Services (T1021)

Exploiting credentials and access to the Azure Application Gateway can facilitate lateral movement within a cloud environment. Attackers might leverage the gateway as a pivot point, accessing internal services or other cloud assets. Segregating network layers and using segmentation strategies can reduce the attack surface and prevent unauthorized lateral movement.

### Collection - Network Sniffing (T1040)

Attackers with the ability to monitor traffic through an Azure Application Gateway could conduct network sniffing activities, capturing sensitive data like authentication tokens and user credentials. The implementation of strong encryption and ensuring end-to-end SSL/TLS communication can mitigate the risk of data interception.

### Command and Control - Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105)

Malicious actors could use compromised Application Gateway configurations to transfer malicious tools or payloads into a protected environment. By exploiting permitted protocols and open ports, attackers could introduce malware or scripts. Implement security best practices such as limiting inbound connections and continuous traffic monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized ingress.

### Impact - Data Manipulation (T1565)

Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the Azure Application Gateway allows attackers to tamper with data being processed or transmitted. This can lead to errors, fraud, or the delivery of altered information to end-users. Regular patching, implementing intrusion detection systems, and encrypting data during transmission help in mitigating these threats.
