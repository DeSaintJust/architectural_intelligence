**Initial Access - Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190):** Attackers may target Azure AI Services by exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications hosted within the Azure environment. By leveraging unpatched or zero-day vulnerabilities, adversaries can gain unauthorized access to the Azure AI infrastructure. This initial foothold can enable attackers to deploy additional payloads or expand their reach within the compromised systems.

**Execution - PowerShell (T1059.001):** Once inside an Azure environment, adversaries might utilize PowerShell to execute malicious commands or scripts. Azure's cloud environment, like others, frequently uses automation scripts, making PowerShell a common target. Attackers can exploit legitimate credentials or pivot from compromised systems to run scripts that manipulate Azure AI Services for data exfiltration or further infiltration.

**Persistence - Account Manipulation (T1098):** Threat actors may attempt to alter or create new accounts to maintain persistence within Azure AI Services. This can include manipulating permissions and roles within Azure Active Directory that manage access to AI services, allowing continuous access even if initial infiltration vectors are closed or detected.

**Privilege Escalation - Access Token Manipulation (T1134):** In Azure, attackers can potentially escalate privileges by manipulating access tokens. These tokens are often used for authenticating various services and applications within Azure. If compromised or forged, these tokens provide adversaries with elevated access to Azure AI Services, leading to broader system control and potential data breaches.

**Credential Access - Credential Dumping (T1003):** Azure AI Services can be targeted for credential dumping, where attackers extract stored passwords or keys within the Azure environment. These credentials might belong to service accounts or administrative accounts, providing adversaries with legitimate access to system resources and sensitive data.

**Discovery - Cloud Service Discovery (T1526):** Attackers may engage in thorough reconnaissance to discover cloud services deployed within an Azure subscription. This includes identifying Azure AI Services workloads and other related services. By mapping the cloud environment, adversaries can tailor subsequent attack phases to exploit discovered services.

**Lateral Movement - Cloud Services (T1570):** Within an Azure environment, attackers might exploit service trust relationships or misconfigurations to move laterally. Azure AI Services integrated with other components, like databases or storage solutions, can be leveraged by attackers to pivot across systems, exploiting token-based authentication or seamless integration pathways.

**Collection - Data from Local System (T1005):** Malicious actors having access to Azure AI Services could collect sensitive data processed or generated by these services. This might include AI model outputs, datasets, or sensitive logs stored locally on virtual machines or containers within the Azure environment.

**Exfiltration - Exfiltration over Alternative Protocol (T1048):** Data processed by Azure AI Services may be exfiltrated using non-standard protocols or covert channels to evade detection by network monitoring solutions. Attackers could deploy novel techniques to bypass security controls and efficiently extract valuable data.

**Impact - Service Stop (T1489):** Adversaries targeting Azure AI Services may aim to disrupt operations by attempting to stop or disable critical services. This denial-of-service technique could be executed by overloading service capacities, introducing malicious scripts, or manipulating service configurations, causing availability issues and service downtime.
