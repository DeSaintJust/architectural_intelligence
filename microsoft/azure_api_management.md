## Initial Access: Valid Accounts (T1078)
Adversaries may gain initial access to Azure API Management by obtaining valid user credentials. This can occur through phishing, credential stuffing, or from reused passwords from breached data. Once in possession of these credentials, attackers can access the API Management service, potentially altering configurations, accessing sensitive resources, or leveraging the APIs for further malicious activities.

## Execution: Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203)
Adversaries may exploit vulnerabilities in client-side applications that interact with Azure API Management. An attacker could craft malicious API requests that execute code on the client, leading to potential unauthorized operations or deployment of malware within the client environment.

## Persistence: Account Manipulation (T1098)
An attacker could manipulate user accounts within the Azure API Management service to maintain persistence. This might involve creating new accounts with legitimate credentials or altering roles and permissions of existing accounts to ensure continued access even if initial access vectors are discovered and blocked.

## Privilege Escalation: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)
Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in the APIs that are publicly exposed via Azure API Management. Such exploits can lead to unauthorized execution of commands or privilege escalation within the service, potentially allowing attackers to gain administrative control over the API Management resources.

## Defense Evasion: Masquerading (T1036)
Adversaries may use masquerading techniques to disguise malicious API calls as legitimate requests. This could involve altering request headers, user-agent strings, or other attributes of API calls to avoid detection by security monitoring tools and evade defenses.

## Credential Access: Unsecured Credentials (T1552)
If development teams inadvertently store credentials such as API keys or OAuth tokens in insecure locations or hard-code them in application repositories, attackers who gain access to these sources can extract and leverage the credentials to access Azure API Management resources illegitimately.

## Discovery: Cloud Service Discovery (T1526)
Adversaries may probe Azure environments to discover available services, including API Management. This information can be used to identify accessible APIs, determine security posture, and assess potential security weaknesses for further exploitation.

## Lateral Movement: Internal Spearphishing (T1534)
Once an adversary gains access to Azure API Management, they might use it as a platform to conduct internal spearphishing attacks. By leveraging trust from the compromised service, attackers can craft convincing phishing messages to target users within the same tenant or organization.

## Impact: Data Manipulation (T1565)
Through Azure API Management, attackers could manipulate data being processed by the APIs. This might include altering API responses, modifying request parameters, or intercepting data in transit to inject fraudulent or malicious payloads, impacting the integrity of the data.

## Impact: Denial of Service (T1499)
Azure API Management could be targeted with Denial of Service (DoS) attacks where attackers flood the APIs with excessive requests, overwhelming the service capacity. Such an attack can disrupt service availability, making APIs unavailable for legitimate usage.
