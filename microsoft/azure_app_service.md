## Initial Access

### T1078 - Valid Accounts
Azure App Service might be targeted through compromised or stolen credentials. Attackers can leverage valid accounts to access and manipulate application data, configurations, or deploy malicious payloads. Ensure rigorous access controls, multi-factor authentication, and regular rotation of credentials to mitigate this threat.

### T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application
Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications hosted on Azure App Service is a common tactic for gaining initial access. Attackers may utilize known vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or unpatched zero-days to compromise the application or underlying infrastructure. Regular patching and stringent security testing can help mitigate these risks.

## Execution

### T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter
Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on Azure App Service by exploiting vulnerabilities or through misconfigured script execution permissions. This may involve injecting scripts or using legitimate scripting functions to execute unauthorized actions. Implementing input validation, reducing script execution permissions, and using security controls like Azure Web Application Firewall can limit exposure.

## Persistence

### T1543 - Create or Modify System Process
Attackers might make persistent changes to Azure App Service by modifying the application code or configurations to establish a foothold. This includes altering startup scripts or creating malicious listener services. Continuous monitoring of configuration changes and deploying application whitelisting helps to counteract these threats.

## Privilege Escalation

### T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
Vulnerabilities in application or service configuration can be exploited for gaining elevated permissions within Azure App Service. Attackers use these vulnerabilities to gain higher-level access, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or further system compromises. Regular vulnerability assessments and implementing principle of least privilege are essential preventive measures.

## Defense Evasion

### T1218 - System Binary Proxy Execution
Adversaries may use legitimate Azure App Service functionalities or binaries to evade defenses. This technique involves executing compromised applications or scripts as a means to bypass security controls by appearing as normal operations. Leveraging behavior-based detection mechanisms and reducing unnecessary application functionalities can mitigate this risk.

## Credential Access

### T1555 - Credentials from Password Stores
Attackers targeting Azure App Service might attempt to dump credentials stored by the application or exploit insecure data handling practices. This can include accessing API keys, connection strings, or other sensitive credentials stored within the application settings. Encrypting sensitive information and employing managed identities for applications are recommended security practices.

## Discovery

### T1083 - File and Directory Discovery
Attackers often perform reconnaissance on Azure App Service deployments to discover exposed files and sensitive application directories. This may lead to identifying configuration files, sensitive data, or application blueprints. Implement proper access permissions and restrict public file exposure to mitigate such threats.

## Lateral Movement

### T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer
Malicious actors may attempt to transfer tools and scripts from a compromised Azure App Service instance to other resources within the cloud environment. This lateral movement facilitates further exploitation or establishes persistence in other parts of a network. Implementing network segmentation and monitoring cross-app service communications are ways to prevent this.

## Impact

### T1485 - Data Destruction
Azure App Service can be targeted for data destruction attacks where adversaries delete or corrupt data to cause service outages or disrupt operations. Regular backups, implementing role-based access controls, and monitoring for unusual delete operations are effective strategies to safeguard against this threat.

## Exfiltration

### T1567 - Exfiltration Over External Web Service
Data hosted within Azure App Service might be exfiltrated using external web services as a channel. Attackers may encode data within legitimate web traffic to bypass detection mechanisms and conduct unauthorized data transfers. Monitoring outbound network traffic and using data loss prevention solutions can help identify and prevent exfiltration activities.
