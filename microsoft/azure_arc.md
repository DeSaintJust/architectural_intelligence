### Initial Access: Drive-by Compromise (T1189)
Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in web browsers or Azure-connected services to gain unauthorized access. A common method involves enticing the user to visit a malicious page, which could then exploit security flaws in plugins used by integrated Azure Arc resources.

### Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)
This technique involves attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications exposed through Azure Arc. They may leverage known vulnerabilities in serverless functions, containerized applications, or other Arc-managed resources to gain initial access to the environment.

### Credential Access: Brute Force (T1110)
Brute force attacks aim to gain unauthorized access by guessing the credentials of accounts associated with resources governed by Azure Arc. Attackers may test commonly used passwords or attempt numerous password variations.

### Persistence: Web Shell (T1505.003)
Attackers might establish persistence by deploying a web shell on a managed Kubernetes cluster or a virtual machine configuration. This allows continuous access to the system and can be used to execute arbitrary commands and scripts.

### Defense Evasion: Masquerading (T1036)
This involves attackers camouflaging their malicious processes or scripts by renaming them to appear as legitimate software. In an Azure Arc environment, this could mean altering the naming schemes of resources or applications to blend in with expected patterns.

### Lateral Movement: Remote Services (T1021)
Attackers may leverage Azure Arc's connections to Aparate-managed endpoints or other cloud services to move laterally across the network. By exploiting remote services, infiltration can extend beyond the initial point of compromise.

### Collection: Data from Cloud Storage Object (T1530)
Attackers could target Azure Blob storage or other cloud-stored data resources managed under Azure Arc. They may gather sensitive information from misconfigured storage permissions or unsecured APIs.

### Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol (T1071)
Attackers may utilize standard application layer protocols such as HTTP/S to communicate with compromised Azure Arc resources. This can facilitate stealth communication with command and control infrastructure, mimicking normal network traffic.

### Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567)
Data exfiltration could occur via web services by exploiting Azure Arc-managed endpoints. Attackers may take advantage of web service APIs to extract data unnoticed, often using HTTP or HTTPS to blend with legitimate web traffic.
