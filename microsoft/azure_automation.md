### Initial Access

**Valid Accounts (T1078):**  
Attackers may attempt to gain initial access to Azure Automation environments by using valid credentials. This can occur through phishing attacks to capture user credentials or exploiting weak passwords. Once compromised, these accounts can be used to execute automation jobs and potentially elevate privileges within the Azure environment.

### Execution

**Scheduled Task/Job (T1053):**  
Azure Automation allows users to schedule tasks and jobs, which can be exploited by attackers to schedule malicious scripts or commands for later execution. This can lead to persistence or lateral movement within the environment if configured improperly.

**Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059):**  
Azure Automation supports various scripting languages, such as PowerShell and Python. An attacker may utilize these interpreters to run malicious scripts within the environment, potentially accessing sensitive data or moving laterally across systems.

### Persistence

**Account Manipulation (T1098):**  
An attacker with access to Azure Automation can create new accounts or modify existing accounts, granting them persistent access. This may involve creating automation accounts or altering runbook permissions to ensure the attacker maintains a foothold in the environment.

### Privilege Escalation

**Valid Accounts (T1078):**  
Once an attacker gains access to valid accounts within Azure Automation, they may leverage additional permissions or service principals to elevate their privileges, accessing higher-privileged resources or sensitive data within Azure services.

### Defense Evasion

**Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027):**  
Malicious scripts or payloads executed via Azure Automation could be obfuscated to bypass detection mechanisms. Attackers might use techniques like encoding or packing scripts to evade analysis and execution telemetry.

**Masquerading (T1036):**  
An attacker might name malicious automation jobs or scripts to appear legitimate, mimicking common or expected processes, to avoid detection and scrutiny by monitoring systems or administrators.

### Credential Access

**Credentials in Files (T1552):**  
Azure Automation scripts or runbooks might inadvertently contain embedded credentials. If an attacker gains access to these runbooks, they could extract these credentials to access other resources within the Azure environment.

### Discovery

**Cloud Service Discovery (T1580):**  
Attackers leveraging Azure Automation can use it to discover additional cloud services and resources within the victim’s Azure subscription. This discovery phase is critical for attackers to map out the environment and plan subsequent actions.

### Impact

**Data Destruction (T1485):**  
Malicious use of Azure Automation can result in the intentional destruction of data. Attackers can automate the deletion of critical datasets or resources, resulting in significant disruption to applications and services relying on these resources.

**Service Stop (T1489):**  
An attacker may stop or disable essential services by executing commands through Azure Automation to disrupt business operations. This impact can be particularly damaging if the services are critical to the organization’s operations.
