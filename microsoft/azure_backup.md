### Initial Access: Phishing (T1566)
Phishing attacks can be used to compromise credentials for accounts with access to Azure Backup services. Attackers send malicious emails or links designed to trick users into providing their login information or downloading malware, which could then be used to orchestrate unauthorized access to backup data.

### Execution: Remote Command Execution (T1059.001)
An attacker who gains initial access to a system or an account with management privileges may execute remote commands on the infrastructure that hosts Azure Backup, altering backup configurations, or initiating unauthorized backups or deletions.

### Persistence: Valid Accounts (T1078)
Attackers may leverage compromised accounts with legitimate access to Azure Backup. This technique can allow persistent access to backup resources, enabling further manipulation or exfiltration of sensitive data over time without raising immediate suspicion.

### Privilege Escalation: Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1548)
If an attacker gains limited access to Azure Backup resources, they might exploit Azure role-based access control (RBAC) flaws or escalate privileges through misconfigurations. This can lead to unauthorized management of backup data with elevated rights.

### Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses (T1562)
Attackers targeting Azure Backup could disable security features, such as encryption, logging, or alerts, to conceal their activities. By impairing these defenses, malicious activities around backup data might go unnoticed, increasing the attack's stealthiness.

### Credential Access: OS Credential Dumping (T1003)
Azure Backup operations might be compromised if attackers extract credentials from systems that have previously accessed Azure Backup services. Using methods like dumping memory or exploiting saved credentials, attackers can replay these for unauthorized access.

### Discovery: Cloud Service Discovery (T1580)
Attackers will attempt to discover configurations of Azure Backup services by reviewing cloud resource metadata or examining configurations for vulnerabilities. This information can be crucial in planning further exploitation or lateral movement.

### Lateral Movement: Remote Services (T1021)
Through compromised accounts, attackers may access other services within the Azure environment linked to backups, such as Storage Accounts or VMs. Lateral movement enables deeper penetration into the environment, potentially accessing or tampering with backup data.

### Collection: Data from Cloud Storage (T1530)
Azure Backup data stored in cloud storage can be targeted for collection and exfiltration. Attackers might use misconfigured permissions, exhausted API limits, or vulnerable software dependencies to extract sensitive backup data from storage.

### Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol (T1048.003)
Exfiltrating Azure Backup data might involve using encryption protocols, such as HTTPS, to conceal data transfer aligns with normal service operations. Attackers can thus blend their data theft activities with legitimate backup and restore processes.

### Impact: Data Destruction (T1485)
An attacker who gains access to Azure Backup might intentionally delete or corrupt backup data with the goal of disrupting business operations. This could be part of a larger ransomware attack strategy, forcing victims to pay to recover lost data.
