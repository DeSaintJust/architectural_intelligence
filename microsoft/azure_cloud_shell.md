### Initial Access - Valid Accounts (T1078)

One significant threat to Azure Cloud Shell is the misuse of valid accounts. Adversaries can gain access to the cloud shell environment through compromised credentials obtained via phishing attacks, credential stuffing, or brute force tactics. This legitimate entry point can allow adversaries to run commands and scripts within an Azure environment, abusing the trust associated with the compromised accounts.

### Execution - Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)

Azure Cloud Shell is susceptible to threats from unauthorized execution of commands and scripts. Adversaries can use the command and scripting interpreter available in the shell to execute malicious scripts written in Bash or PowerShell. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification of cloud resources, or the launching of further attacks within the environment.

### Persistence - Account Manipulation (T1098)

Adversaries may attempt to establish persistence in Azure Cloud Shell by manipulating user accounts. This includes adding or modifying account credentials and permissions to maintain long-term access to the cloud environment. Such manipulation allows adversaries to return to the environment at will and potentially evade detection.

### Privilege Escalation - Access Token Manipulation (T1134)

Access token manipulation poses a threat to Azure Cloud Shell, as adversaries may elevate privileges by intercepting, replaying, or otherwise abusing tokens. Once an access token is manipulated, adversaries can impersonate users or escalate privileges which allows for executing actions on behalf of the higher-privileged user, potentially causing further exploitation within the environment.

### Defense Evasion - Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)

Adversaries may employ techniques to evade defenses in Azure Cloud Shell by obfuscating files or information. This can involve encoding scripts or using various forms of data hiding to bypass security mechanisms and avoid detection by defensive tools. This obfuscation hampers the ability to identify and respond to unauthorized activities effectively.

### Credential Access - Input Capture (T1056)

Adversaries can employ input capture techniques in Azure Cloud Shell to harvest credentials. This can involve keylogging or other input capturing tools within the shell environment to intercept sensitive information. Captured credentials can then be used to access and maneuver within the cloud environment deceitfully.

### Discovery - Cloud Service Discovery (T1526)

Azure Cloud Shell can be targeted for discovery techniques by adversaries seeking to enumerate cloud services and gather information about the existing environment. This can involve querying the Azure environment to list resources, services, and configurations, providing insights to further plan attacks or identify weak points for exploitation.

### Collection - Data from Cloud Storage Object (T1530)

Adversaries may attempt to collect data from cloud storage objects available within Azure Cloud Shell. This involves accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data from storage services connected or accessible from the shell environment. Unauthorized data collection can lead to data breaches and information theft critical to operations.

### Command and Control - Web Service (T1102)

Azure Cloud Shell may be exploited for command and control (C2) purposes through interaction with external web services. Adversaries can set up C2 channels using HTTP or other protocols to remotely control devices and exfiltrate data. This can facilitate prolonged, covert access to the cloud environment for continued exploitation.

### Impact - Resource Hijacking (T1496)

Resource hijacking is an impact-based threat to Azure Cloud Shell where adversaries utilize cloud resources for unauthorized purposes, such as cryptocurrency mining or launching attacks against other systems. This unauthorized usage can result in increased costs and degraded performance of legitimate services.
