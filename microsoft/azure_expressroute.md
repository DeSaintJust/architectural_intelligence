### Initial Access - [T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)

Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in the systems interfacing with Azure ExpressRoute, such as enterprise applications or web services, to gain unauthorized access. For example, they may leverage outdated APIs or services exposed to both Azure VNet and on-premises networks, aiming to penetrate the connected environments. Keeping these entry points up-to-date and monitored is essential to mitigate risks of exploitation.

### Persistence - [T1574: Hijack Execution Flow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/)

Attackers might attempt to maintain persistence by implementing techniques that hijack execution flows within the interconnected networks provided by Azure ExpressRoute. They may redirect legitimate network traffic through compromised paths, thus establishing stealthy command and control channels or maintaining persistent access to data flows between cloud and on-prem resources.

### Defense Evasion - [T1036.005: Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/)

An adversary may masquerade malicious traffic or actions as legitimate network communication by matching the names or characteristics of legitimate services. For instance, they might spoof network device names or use commonly trusted IPs to hide their actions among regular ExpressRoute traffic, making detection and response more challenging.

### Credential Access - [T1548.002: Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002/)

Malicious actors may focus on obtaining elevated credentials within the networks connected via Azure ExpressRoute by bypassing control mechanisms such as User Account Controls (UAC). Once obtained, these credentials could be used to access sensitive information, alter network configurations, or expand their foothold within connected systems.

### Discovery - [T1040: Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040/)

Monitoring communications across ExpressRoute connections can reveal significant network activity details. Adversaries may employ network sniffing to gather sensitive information, such as credentials, configuration details, or data flows, which can facilitate further attacks or lateral movement.

### Lateral Movement - [T1021: Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/)

Attackers may exploit ExpressRoute connections to move laterally between distinct network segments or between on-premises and cloud environments. They could use remote services like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Secure Shell (SSH) to compromise systems and propagate their reach across the interconnected networks.

### Collection - [T1074.001: Data Staged: Local Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/001/)

Malicious actors who gain access to environments interconnected by ExpressRoute may collect and stage data on local systems before exfiltration. This behavior helps them systematically gather valuable information from both on-prem and cloud environments, making efficient use of the high-throughput, low-latency connections provided by ExpressRoute.

### Command and Control - [T1071.003: Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/003/)

Command and control activities may be conducted through web protocols over ExpressRoute connections. Adversaries could leverage common, legitimate application layer protocols, such as HTTPS, to conceal the command and control communications within normal network traffic, thus avoiding detection.

### Impact - [T1489: Service Stop](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1489/)

Adversaries might aim to disrupt operations by stopping critical services that rely on ExpressRoute for connectivity. This can lead to service outages or loss of business-critical application access between hybrid cloud environments, impacting both operational efficiency and potentially causing reputational damage. Regular monitoring and failover mechanisms can help safeguard against such disruptions.
