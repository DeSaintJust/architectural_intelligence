### Network Service Scanning (T1046)
An attacker may perform network service scanning to identify vulnerable services running on Azure Firewall. This reconnaissance technique involves probing the network to detect open ports and services, leading to the discovery of potentially exploitable vulnerabilities. If an attacker can identify a critical or unpatched service, they could use this information to aid further penetration or exploitation attempts within the environment.

### Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)
Azure Firewall, being a network security service, may expose certain administrative interfaces or services that, if inadequately secured, can be targeted by exploits. Attackers may leverage vulnerabilities in these public-facing services to gain unauthorized access or disrupt the firewall's functionality. Patching and maintaining up-to-date software versions are crucial to mitigating this risk.

### Brute Force (T1110)
In scenarios where Azure Firewall uses credentials for administrative access or integration with other services, brute force attacks may pose a threat. Attackers might try numerous password combinations or leverage common credential lists to gain unauthorized administrative access. Implementing strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) is critical to defending against this technique.

### Credential Dumping (T1003)
If an attacker gains initial access to the network, they may attempt to perform credential dumping within Azure Firewall's environment to obtain administrative credentials. If successful, these credentials can be leveraged to escalate privileges or move laterally within other network segments. Utilizing system hardening and monitoring for unusual access patterns can help mitigate the risk.

### Man-in-the-Middle (T1557)
Azure Firewall, like any network security appliance, may be a target for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, especially if data in transit between cloud services is unencrypted. Attackers may attempt to intercept or alter communications to exfiltrate data or redirect traffic for malicious purposes. To counter this threat, ensure that all network communications are encrypted using secure protocols.

### Denial of Service (T1499)
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks aim to render Azure Firewall inoperative by overwhelming it with excessive traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities to exhaust system resources. Such attacks can disrupt legitimate traffic, leading to service inability or degraded performance. Implementing rate-limiting, traffic filtering, and robust disaster recovery strategies can help mitigate DoS risks.

### System Information Discovery (T1082)
An adversary who gains access to Azure Firewall may conduct system information discovery to gather technical details such as version numbers, configurations, and security settings. This information is valuable for planning further attacks or exploiting known vulnerabilities. Auditing and restricting access to sensitive system information is essential to combating this threat.

### Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure (T1578)
Attackers with sufficient privileges may attempt to alter Azure Firewall rules or configurations maliciously. By modifying the firewall infrastructure, an adversary can create new routes for data exfiltration or allow unauthorized access to protected network segments. Strict role-based access controls (RBAC) and continuous monitoring of configuration changes are effective countermeasures.
