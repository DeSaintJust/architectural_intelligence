#### Initial Access - Drive-by Compromise (T1189)
Azure Front Door may be vulnerable to a drive-by compromise attack, where an adversary crafts a malicious webpage or ad that exploits vulnerabilities in a userâ€™s browser or its plugins to deliver malware. Since Azure Front Door routes global user traffic, an attacker could leverage this by attempting to exploit end-user browsers at the edge, especially if the security of the setup is improperly configured.

#### Execution - Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)
Attackers may attempt to exploit Azure Front Door by using command and scripting interpreters, aiming at any misconfigurations or known vulnerabilities within Front Door's services. This could include the exploitation of API endpoints using scripting to further their goals within the Azure ecosystem.

#### Persistence - Valid Accounts (T1078)
One common way attackers may attempt to maintain persistence within an Azure Front Door environment is by compromising valid accounts. This can involve phishing campaigns or exploiting weak credentials. Once inside, these valid accounts allow attackers to bypass some security controls and remain unnoticed.

#### Privilege Escalation - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068)
Azure Front Door configurations could potentially be exploited for privilege escalation purposes. Attackers might look for unpatched vulnerabilities or use APIs improperly configured to escalate their privileges from a regular user to an administrative role within the Azure environment.

#### Defense Evasion - Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)
Attackers may obfuscate malware, scripts, or configuration files to avoid detection by Azure's native security monitoring. This could involve encoding or encrypting payloads that are transmitted through Azure Front Door, making it more difficult for security solutions to detect and mitigate the threat.

#### Credential Access - Brute Force (T1110)
Azure Front Door could be targeted through credential brute-force attacks, where attackers use automated tools to attempt millions of password combinations to gain unauthorized access. This is particularly effective against users with weak password policies or reused credentials across services.

#### Discovery - Network Service Scanning (T1046)
Adversaries might utilize network service scanning to identify open ports and services running within the Azure Front Door infrastructure. This technique can be leveraged to gain information about potential vulnerabilities or unprotected endpoints that could be exploited.

#### Collection - Data from Information Repositories (T1213)
Azure Front Door infrastructures may store logs, configurations, and other data that could be targeted by adversaries to understand more about the network architecture, security practices, or to exfiltrate sensitive information if less-secured repositories are used.

#### Command and Control - Standard Application Layer Protocol (T1071)
Attackers may establish command and control channels within Azure Front Door using standard application layer protocols, such as HTTP/S, to blend in with normal traffic. This allows them to issue commands and receive data back from compromised assets while avoiding detection by looking like legitimate traffic.

#### Impact - Service Stop (T1489)
An attacker could potentially stop Azure Front Door services to disrupt the availability of applications relying on this service. Such an attack could be part of a broader denial-of-service campaign designed to make critical applications and services inaccessible to legitimate users.
