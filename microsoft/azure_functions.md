## Initial Access: T1133 - External Remote Services
Azure Functions can be exposed to vulnerabilities if external remote access is enabled improperly. Threat actors may exploit remote access configurations to execute unauthorized entry into cloud environments where Azure Functions are hosted. Once an attacker gains entry via compromised credentials or misconfigured permissions, they can deploy malicious functions or manipulate existing ones.

## Execution: T1059.006 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Python
Azure Functions that use Python as a runtime may be susceptible to command injection attacks if inputs are not properly sanitized. Attackers could execute arbitrary Python code, potentially leading to data exposure or compromise of the function's integrity. This can further propagate into unauthorized operations within the Azure environment.

## Persistence: T1078 - Valid Accounts
An attack strategy involves using compromised credentials to maintain persistence in an environment hosting Azure Functions. By acquiring valid keys or credentials through phishing, credential stuffing, or other means, attackers can authenticate and maintain a foothold in the cloud, leading to prolonged unauthorized access and data manipulation.

## Privilege Escalation: T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
In situations where Azure Functions have been configured with excessive permissions, adversaries can exploit these misconfigurations to escalate privileges. Such escalations could allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions, including altering sensitive configurations or accessing privileged data and systems across the Azure network.

## Defense Evasion: T1562 - Impair Defenses
Attackers may disable logging or monitoring within Azure Functions to evade detection. By tampering with diagnostic logs or application insights, they can conceal malicious activities and maintain stealth. This evasion tactic helps in prolonging their operation without triggering security alerts, resulting in a delayed incident response.

## Credential Access: T1552.001 - Unsecured Credentials: Credentials in Files
Stored secrets or API keys within Azure Functions' configuration files or code repositories present a risk if not handled securely. If these credentials are accessed by an attacker, it can lead to broader unauthorized access not only to the function but also to other integrated resources, thereby escalating the breach's impact.

## Discovery: T1083 - File and Directory Discovery
Attackers leveraging compromised access might perform file and directory discovery operations on Azure Functions to identify sensitive information or security weaknesses. This reconnaissance helps in mapping out the environment for strategic exploitation, assisting further phases of attack such as data exfiltration or lateral movement.

## Lateral Movement: T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer
Azure Functions may be used to transfer malicious tools across an Azure cloud environment. Once compromised, attackers can use these serverless functions to deploy malware or other attack tools to additional resources, facilitating movement and expanding control within the cloud infrastructure.

## Collection: T1114 - Email Collection
Azure Functions connected to email services could be exploited to intercept and collect email communications. If an attacker gains access, they could misuse functions to process and siphon off email data, exposing sensitive communications and potentially leading to further exploitation based on collected intelligence.

## Exfiltration: T1048 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol
Attackers may utilize Azure Functions to exfiltrate data using non-standard protocols to avoid detection. By configuring functions to communicate with external servers over less monitored pathways, they can obscure exfiltration efforts, allowing sensitive information to be transferred out of the secure cloud environment stealthily.

## Impact: T1499 - Endpoint Denial of Service
Exploiting Azure Functions with excessive or malformed requests can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Attackers may attempt to overload the function's compute resources or affect downstream dependencies, thereby degrading service availability and causing disruptions to legitimate users and business operations.
