## Initial Access - Drive-by Compromise
A Drive-by Compromise involves an adversary gaining access to an IoT device through a malicious website or web-based application. In Azure IoT, this could happen if a device interacts with compromised cloud services or endpoints, which then exploit vulnerabilities in device software or configurations to execute unauthorized code.

## Initial Access - Supply Chain Compromise
Supply Chain Compromise impacts Azure IoT by adversaries tampering with the software updates or device firmware that end up deployed on IoT devices. An attacker might target the development and distribution networks associated with Azure IoT solutions, impacting the integrity of the distributed software.

## Execution - Command and Scripting Interpreter
IoT devices on Azure may be targeted through command and scripting interpreters. Malicious scripts could be executed using shell access if the device's management interfaces are improperly secured or if adversaries have managed to escalate privileges on the device itself.

## Execution - Native API
Adversaries can exploit vulnerabilities in APIs provided by Azure IoT by crafting specific API calls that can execute unauthorized commands. By leveraging exposed or weak API endpoints, especially those inadvertently exposed to the internet, attackers can undertake a variety of malicious activities.

## Persistence - Implantation
Persistence mechanisms like implantation involve embedding malicious code on the device, which remains even after reboots. It can affect Azure IoT devices by exploiting firmware vulnerabilities or utilizing unauthorized firmware updates to insert backdoors for ongoing access.

## Privilege Escalation - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
Exploitation for Privilege Escalation is a crucial threat where adversaries take advantage of vulnerabilities within an IoT device's software or firmware to gain higher privilege levels. This can allow complete control of the device and its interactions with the Azure cloud infrastructure.

## Defense Evasion - Obfuscated Files or Information
Adversaries could use obfuscation techniques to hide malicious payloads within Azure IoT environments, ensuring their activities are not easily detectable. This includes employing encrypted payloads or code obfuscation so the true intent of their operations is masked from security systems.

## Credential Access - Credential Dumping
Credential Dumping involves extracting credentials, such as API keys or authentication tokens, from IoT devices. Attackers could target improperly secured credentials stored on devices or in configuration repositories associated with Azure IoT solutions.

## Discovery - Network Service Discovery
Network Service Discovery is used by adversaries to map out which services are running on IoT devices within an Azure IoT deployment. This can involve probing network ports and services to identify exploitable services or gather intelligence on the network setup.

## Collection - Data from Local System
In Azure IoT, adversaries might attempt to collect data from the local system, including sensitive configurations or telemetry data stored locally on devices. Unauthorized data collection can be achieved through direct access to the devices or via compromised cloud interfaces.

## Command and Control - Standard Application Layer Protocol
This involves the use of common application layer protocols such as HTTP(S) or MQTT to establish and maintain communications with compromised IoT devices. Such protocols are commonly allowed through network defenses, making it easier for attackers to communicate with their malicious payloads.

## Exfiltration - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol refers to sending stolen data out from IoT devices using less common protocols or non-standard ports. In Azure IoT environments, attackers might use IoT-specific protocols or toolsets to bypass traditional security monitoring and data exfiltration controls.

## Impact - Data Manipulation
Data Manipulation involves unauthorized changes to data payloads within an IoT environment. In Azure IoT, adversaries could alter telemetry data sent from devices to the cloud, thus skewing analytics and the operational view of the IoT ecosystem, potentially leading to ill-informed decisions.
