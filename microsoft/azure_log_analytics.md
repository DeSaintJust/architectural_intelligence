### Initial Access - Valid Accounts (T1078)
Threat actors may obtain valid user credentials to gain unauthorized access to Azure Log Analytics. This could occur through phishing attacks, credential stuffing, or exploiting weak passwords. Once inside, attackers can access logged data, potentially allowing them to maintain persistence or escalate privileges within the environment.

### Execution - Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)
Attackers might execute malicious scripts or commands within Azure Log Analytics to manipulate collected log data or disrupt logging operations. Commonly exploited interpreters such as PowerShell or Python can be misused to execute commands on collected log data, potentially leading to data theft or manipulation.

### Persistence - Account Manipulation (T1098)
Threat actors might attempt to create new accounts or manipulate existing ones to maintain long-term access to Azure Log Analytics environments. This can help them stay undetected while monitoring logs, which may aid in further reconnaissance or data exfiltration efforts.

### Privilege Escalation - Access Token Manipulation (T1134)
Adversaries could manipulate access tokens to gain elevated permissions in Azure Log Analytics. By stealing or forging tokens, they might bypass authentication controls and execute privileged operations within the environment, increasing the scope of their attack.

### Defense Evasion - Log Deletion (T1070.001)
An attacker might delete or alter collected logs to cover their tracks and avoid detection. By targeting critical logs or modifying their content, adversaries attempt to obfuscate their activities, making it more challenging for security teams to perform accurate forensic analysis.

### Credential Access - Credential Dumping (T1003)
In Azure Log Analytics, attackers might attempt to extract sensitive credentials stored within the environment. This can occur if logs mistakenly capture credentials or if attackers exploit vulnerabilities to access secured data, enabling them to extend their reach to other systems.

### Discovery - Cloud Service Dashboard (T1538)
Attackers may exploit Azure Log Analytics dashboards to discover insights about the cloud environment. Using legitimate user access, they can explore logs to identify system configurations, network structures, and security controls critical for planning future attacks.

### Collection - Data from Local System (T1005)
Adversaries can target log data by directly collecting it from local systems that feed into Azure Log Analytics. By gaining local system access, they might intercept or alter logs before they're sent to the cloud, potentially extracting sensitive information for further exploitation.

### Command and Control - Application Layer Protocol (T1071.001)
Threat actors could use legitimate protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with Azure Log Analytics, making their command and control traffic blend with normal API interactions. This allows attackers to stealthily issue commands and receive data without raising red flags.

### Exfiltration - Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567.002)
Azure Log Analytics might be exploited as a means to exfiltrate data by embedding sensitive information within logs that are transmitted over the internet. Adversaries abuse the legitimate functions of the service to smuggle data out, circumventing traditional data loss prevention strategies.
