### Initial Access

**Phishing: Spear Phishing Link (T1566.002)**  
Attackers may craft a targeted phishing email with a link directing Azure Repos users to a malicious site designed to harvest credentials. Successful credential compromise could allow unauthorized access to the repository, leading to further exploitation.

**Supply Chain Compromise (T1195)**  
Adversaries might infiltrate third-party software dependencies or code libraries integrated into Azure Repos, introducing vulnerabilities or malicious code that triggers upon deployment, thereby compromising the development and production environments.

### Execution

**Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell (T1059.001)**  
Malicious users could exploit developer misconfigurations in build scripts or continuous integration systems using PowerShell scripts embedded within Azure Repos. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or manipulate build processes, leading to potential code injection.

### Persistence

**Account Manipulation (T1098)**  
Compromised credentials can be leveraged to alter user accounts within Azure Repos, including permissions and settings. Adversaries may escalate privileges or establish persistent access to maintain their foothold within the development environment.

### Privilege Escalation

**Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068)**  
Vulnerabilities within integrated services or applications connected to Azure Repos can be exploited to escalate privileges. Attackers with elevated rights may change critical configuration or access restricted parts of the codebase.

### Defense Evasion

**Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)**  
Obfuscation techniques may be employed by attackers to hide unauthorized changes or backdoors within code hosted in Azure Repos. This might involve code minification or using complex scripts to evade detection during reviews.

### Credential Access

**Access Token Manipulation (T1528)**  
Adversaries could manipulate access tokens associated with Azure Repos' CI/CD systems to impersonate legitimate automation processes. This can enable unauthorized repository access and action execution as part of advanced attack scenarios.

### Discovery

**Network Service Scanning (T1046)**  
Malicious parties may scan for misconfigured or exposed services connected to Azure Repos. Discovery of vulnerabilities or open interfaces can then be exploited to gather further information or gain access to sensitive elements in the environment.

### Lateral Movement

**Internal Spearphishing (T1534)**  
An attacker who gains initial access to Azure Repos might craft spear-phishing attacks targeting internal users by leveraging gathered corporate or personal information. This can help the attacker move laterally to additional systems or repositories.

### Collection

**Data from Information Repositories (T1213)**  
Azure Repos may contain sensitive code or intellectual property that adversaries target for extraction. Techniques such as cloning entire repositories or searching for credentials embedded in code are common methods for data exfiltration.

### Exfiltration

**Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567)**  
Post-compromise, attackers might exfiltrate data using web services. For example, they could use another cloud service to funnel out sensitive information stored in Azure Repos, attempting to evade detection and blend with normal traffic.

### Impact

**Data Destruction (T1485)**  
Malicious actors may delete critical parts of the codebase or repository within Azure Repos, severely disrupting software development processes. Such destruction can result in significant operational setbacks and data recovery challenges.
