### Initial Access Techniques

**Phishing (T1566)**: Cyber adversaries may use phishing techniques to trick users into revealing credentials or installing malicious software, potentially giving attackers access to Azure accounts. These attacks can propagate through emails, messages, or fraudulent login pages, specifically targeting Azure administrators or those with privileged access.

**Valid Accounts (T1078)**: Threat actors might gain initial access by using stolen or leaked credentials to access Azure Resource Manager interfaces. Once authenticated, they can move laterally within the environment, deploying harmful configurations or extracting sensitive information.

### Execution Techniques

**Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)**: Attackers may leverage command-line interfaces and scripting environments available within Azure for executing malicious scripts. For instance, they can use the Azure CLI or PowerShell scripts to automate unauthorized actions in the Azure environment.

### Persistence Techniques

**Account Manipulation (T1098)**: Threat actors may create or modify existing Azure Active Directory accounts to maintain persistent access. They might change permissions or attributes of existing user accounts, or create new accounts with elevated privileges that go unnoticed.

### Privilege Escalation Techniques

**Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1548)**: In Azure, attackers might exploit misconfigured role-based access control (RBAC) to escalate privileges. By gaining access to roles with higher permissions, attackers can perform actions beyond their initial access level.

### Defense Evasion Techniques

**Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)**: Adversaries utilize obfuscation to evade detection while interacting with Azure Resource Manager. They may encrypt scripts or binaries to hide malicious activities, making it difficult for security tools to detect their operations.

### Discovery Techniques

**Cloud Service Discovery (T1580)**: Attackers often perform reconnaissance to identify services and resources within Azure. This might include listing subscriptions, storage accounts, and virtual machines that could be leveraged for further exploitation.

### Lateral Movement Techniques

**Internal Spearphishing (T1534)**: Attackers who gain a foothold in an Azure environment may conduct spearphishing campaigns within the organization. This technique involves sending targeted phishing emails to employees, leveraging the compromised account to move laterally.

### Impact Techniques

**Data Destruction (T1485)**: This technique involves the deletion or corruption of key resources within Azure. An attacker with sufficient permissions might delete resource groups or services, leading to data loss and operational disruption.

**Service Stop (T1489)**: Adversaries can stop critical services running in Azure by abusing permissions to shut down or reboot virtual machines and services, impacting the availability of applications and services.
