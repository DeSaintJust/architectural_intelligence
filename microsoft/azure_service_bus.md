### Initial Access: Valid Accounts
An adversary may attempt to gain unauthorized access to Azure Service Bus by obtaining valid credentials. Techniques like password spraying, credential stuffing, or phishing could be used to compromise user accounts. Compromised accounts allow attackers to interact with the Service Bus, potentially leading to data exfiltration or service disruption.

### Discovery: Cloud Service Discovery
Adversaries may use their initial access to explore the Azure environment and discover cloud services, such as Azure Service Bus, that can be targeted. Cloud APIs or CLI tools can be used to list available services, gather metadata, and understand the service configuration, which can inform further exploitation or lateral movement.

### Privilege Escalation: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
Attackers may exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities within Azure Service Bus or its configurations to elevate their access permissions. By gaining higher levels of privilege, adversaries can manage configurations, send or receive messages illicitly, and control other connected Azure resources.

### Defense Evasion: Application Layer Protocol Manipulation
To avoid detection, adversaries might manipulate the application layer protocols used by Azure Service Bus. By altering message headers, encryption parameters, or mimicking legitimate traffic patterns, attackers can blend in with normal service interactions and evade security monitoring efforts.

### Execution: Command and Script Execution
With appropriate permissions, adversaries can execute commands or scripts using Azure Service Bus to automate tasks, deploy malicious payloads, or alter service configurations. They may leverage Azure Automation or embedded scripting capabilities to execute these actions stealthily.

### Lateral Movement: Cloud API
Once inside the Azure environment, adversaries may leverage cloud APIs to move laterally, targeting other instances of Azure services such as the Service Bus. Using API calls, attackers can interact with interconnected resources, potentially spreading their influence across the cloud landscape.

### Collection: Data from Local System
Adversaries can collect sensitive information from the Azure Service Bus environment by intercepting messages or reading configuration data. This data harvesting could be directed towards identifying valuable information stored in messages or exploiting any data management weaknesses.

### Impact: Data Destruction
Attackers with sufficient access could destroy data stored and managed by Azure Service Bus. This destruction could disrupt services relying on message queues, topics, or subscriptions managed by the Service Bus, resulting in significant operational and business impact.

### Impact: Data Exfiltration
Adversaries might exfiltrate sensitive data from Azure Service Bus by exporting message contents or configuration details. Exfiltrated data can include application data, service configurations, and user credentials, posing substantial risks to confidentiality and compliance.
