### T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application
Attackers may target vulnerabilities in the Azure Site Recovery's public-facing interfaces. By exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in APIs, attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive disaster recovery configurations or disrupt the continuity and replication processes. Ensuring timely patch management and secure coding practices are fundamental in mitigating this risk.

### T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services
Exploitation of remote services involves attackers targeting protocols and services that Azure Site Recovery depends on, like RDP or SMB, to gain unauthorized access. Attackers who successfully exploit these services can compromise the integrity and availability of the recovery process. Regularly monitoring for unusual activity and applying updated security configurations can mitigate potential exploits.

### T1078 - Valid Accounts
The use of valid accounts is a technique whereby attackers leverage stolen or improperly managed credentials to access Azure Site Recovery accounts. This can lead to unauthorized modifications or disruptions in disaster recovery plans. Enforcing strong authentication mechanisms and implementing identity protection measures are effective defenses against this threat.

### T1556.004 - Credential Access: Adversary-in-the-Middle
Azure Site Recovery operations could be targeted by adversary-in-the-middle attacks, where attackers intercept and potentially alter data in transit between the source and recovery sites. Securing data with end-to-end encryption and using secure communication channels can mitigate this risk. Regular traffic monitoring for anomalies is also crucial.

### T1562.001 - Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools
Attackers might attempt to disable or alter Azure Site Recovery configurations or monitoring tools. By doing so, they could prevent the system from functioning correctly, rendering backup operations ineffective during a recovery scenario. Ensuring that tamper-evident logging and audit controls are in place can detect unauthorized modifications.

### T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information
Obfuscation techniques may be used by attackers to hide malicious activity within Azure Site Recovery operations. This could involve embedding malicious scripts or files within legitimate replication data, bypassing antivirus and intrusion detection systems. Implementing advanced threat protection and robust file integrity monitoring can help detect and prevent such attempts.

### T1499.004 - Endpoint Denial of Service
Attackers may perform denial of service attacks on endpoint systems that Azure Site Recovery relies on, impacting the availability and performance of backup and recovery operations. Leveraging distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection services and designing scalable, resilient infrastructure can help defend against these attacks.

### T1583.006 - Acquire Infrastructure: Botnet
Botnets can be instrumental in launching massive, coordinated efforts to disrupt Azure Site Recovery processes. These can increase the attack surface via distributed attacks from compromised IoT devices or other systems, overwhelming the service. Utilizing threat intelligence and implementing network segmentation can help mitigate this threat.

### T1102.002 - Web Service: Domain Fronting
Domain fronting may be used as a technique to obscure command and control (C2) communications relevant to Azure Site Recovery. Leveraging legitimate but compromised domains for malicious activities can escape detection and tracking efforts. Incorporating robust network filtering and anomaly detection practices in network communications can thwart such activities.

### T1531 - Account Access Removal
Attackers might attempt to remove access to Azure Site Recovery accounts, thereby preventing legitimate recovery actions during an incident. Implementing role-based access controls, regular access audits, and backup administrative accounts are essential strategies to ensure persistent and secure control over disaster recovery functions.
