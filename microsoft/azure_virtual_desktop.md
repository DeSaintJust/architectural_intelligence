### Credential Dumping (T1003)

Azure Virtual Desktop environments are susceptible to credential dumping, where attackers extract cached credentials from memory, disk, or OS components. Attackers may target LSASS memory to obtain user credentials, including passwords and Kerberos ticket-granting tickets, allowing unauthorized access to Azure AD and other critical resources within the environment.

### Phishing (T1566)

Phishing remains a significant threat to Azure Virtual Desktops. Attackers may send deceptive emails with malicious links or attachments to users to harvest credentials or install malware. Once they obtain access, they can move laterally within the Azure Virtual Desktop environment or exfiltrate sensitive data.

### Remote Services (T1021)

Attackers could exploit remote services such as RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to gain unauthorized access to Azure Virtual Desktop. By using brute force methods, stolen credentials, or exploiting vulnerabilities, adversaries can establish remote sessions and execute malicious activities.

### Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068)

In Azure Virtual Desktop, attackers may exploit software vulnerabilities to escalate privileges. Once initial access is achieved, they might leverage unpatched or zero-day exploits to increase their permissions, enabling them to carry out further malicious actions undeterred by typical user-level restrictions.

### Persistence (T1547)

Maintaining persistence within Azure Virtual Desktop can involve several methods, such as creating or modifying services, scheduled tasks, or startup items. Attackers may use these techniques to ensure continued access even if initial compromise factors like credentials are mitigated.

### Lateral Movement (T1563)

Attackers can exploit the Azure Virtual Desktop architecture to move laterally throughout the network, using protocols like RDP, SMB, or other administrative interfaces. This mobility can facilitate the compromise of additional hosts or resources within the Azure environment.

### Data Destruction (T1485)

An attacker with access to an Azure Virtual Desktop may aim to destroy sensitive data as part of a sabotage effort. This could involve deleting critical files, executing destructive scripts, or manipulating virtual desktop environments to make data irretrievable.

### Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567)

Azure Virtual Desktop environments face exfiltration risks where sensitive data is transferred outside the organization via web services. Attackers can use cloud storages or online services to stealthily export data, avoiding network monitoring defenses commonly focused on traditional protocols.

### Defense Evasion (T1562)

Adversaries may attempt to disable or manipulate security features within Azure Virtual Desktop, such as antivirus software, firewall settings, or monitoring services. By evading detection, they can maintain their foothold and continue operations without raising alarms.

### Hijack Execution Flow (T1574)

Threat actors can target the execution flow within Azure Virtual Desktop processes by DLL hijacking, process injection, or using other hijacking techniques. This allows them to execute arbitrary code, often with higher privileges, without detection from regular security defenses.

### Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105)

Malicious actors may transfer tools into the Azure Virtual Desktop environment to facilitate their operations. These tools can be used for further exploitation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration, and are typically brought in through methods like remote upload or direct download.

### Impair Defenses (T1562)

Adversaries may take steps to impair defenses within Azure Virtual Desktop by disabling security tools, obstructing logging, or otherwise tampering with built-in protections. This can help them mask their activities and persist in the environment unnoticed.
