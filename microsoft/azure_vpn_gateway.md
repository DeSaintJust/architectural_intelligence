### Initial Access - Valid Accounts (T1078)
An adversary might compromise valid accounts through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute force attacks to gain unauthorized access to Azure VPN Gateway. This allows attackers to legitimate user access to VPN services, potentially leading to unauthorized network exposure and traversal. Once they authenticate, attackers can exploit the gateway to access other connected networks and services, making detection difficult.

### Persistence - Account Manipulation (T1098)
Once access is achieved, attackers might create new accounts or modify existing ones to maintain persistent access to the Azure environment. By adding or changing user credentials on the Azure Active Directory (AAD), attackers ensure they can return even if initial threat vectors are mitigated, undermining the security of the VPN gateway.

### Credential Access - Credential Dumping (T1003)
Attackers may attempt to dump credentials from compromised systems or databases connected to the Azure VPN Gateway. Gaining access to the credentials stored, such as AAD credentials or secret keys used for VPN server operations, permits further infiltrations or privilege escalations within the Azure environment.

### Defense Evasion - Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)
Using encryption or encoding, attackers may obfuscate their tools and payloads to bypass security controls and monitoring when operating through Azure VPN Gateway. This can involve utilities like PowerShell scripts or external malware that manage to avoid detection due to their obfuscation techniques, compromising the gateway environment's integrity.

### Credential Access - Steal Web Session Cookie (T1539)
Attackers might capture web session cookies via man-in-the-middle attacks on Azure VPN connections, enabling them to hijack VPN sessions without needing passwords. This sub-technique helps them impersonate legitimate users and maintain access to sensitive resources across the cloud network.

### Lateral Movement - Internal Spearphishing (T1534)
With access to user accounts on Azure VPN Gateway, attackers may conduct spear-phishing operations internally across the organization’s network. This method leverages the breached user's identity to transmit malware or phishing links, facilitating further compromise of internal systems and lateral movement.

### Command and Control - Encrypted Channel (T1573)
An attacker might use encrypted communication channels to interact with malware or control components deployed on a compromised system accessed via Azure VPN Gateway. Establishing encrypted connections to a command and control server prevents detection by network monitoring tools, ensuring ongoing clandestine operations.

### Impact - Data Destruction (T1485)
Threat actors, once inside through the VPN Gateway, may employ techniques that lead to data destruction, targeting critical cloud resources like storage accounts within Azure. Their motives can vary from sabotaging the enterprise’s activities to concealing other malicious operations through deliberate tampering and data wipeouts.

### Impact - Resource Hijacking (T1496)
Attackers with access to Azure VPN Gateway could exploit this foothold to engage in resource hijacking, such as illegal cryptocurrency mining operations on enterprise cloud resources. The attacker leverages this unauthorized consumption of resources to achieve financial gain, misutilizing VPN-facilitated network access.
