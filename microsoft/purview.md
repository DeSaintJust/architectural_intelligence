### T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution
One potential threat to Microsoft Purview is exploitation for client execution, where an attacker could exploit a vulnerability within the Purview client application or its dependencies. By identifying unpatched software or leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities, attackers might execute arbitrary code on the host where the client is installed, which could lead to unauthorized access to Purview's dashboards or sensitive data management capabilities.

### T1078 - Valid Accounts
Attackers can take advantage of valid accounts by obtaining credentials through phishing, social engineering, or other means. With legitimate user credentials, they can access Microsoft Purview's management consoles or APIs to exfiltrate sensitive information or modify data policies without raising immediate suspicion. This insider threat increases the risk of unauthorized data access and manipulation.

### T1071 - Application Layer Protocol
Using standard application protocols, such as HTTP or HTTPS, attackers can perform command and control activities that blend in with regular usage patterns of Microsoft Purview. By masquerading their malicious traffic as legitimate Purview communication, attackers can avoid detection by network monitoring tools aimed at identifying abnormal behavior, thus maintaining a foothold in the environment.

### T1556 - Modify Authentication Process
Attackers might attempt to alter the authentication process within Microsoft Purview to bypass standard security measures or create backdoors that allow them persistent access. This could involve modifying credential verification mechanisms or manipulating multi-factor authentication settings, thereby compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the data managed by Purview.

### T1106 - Native API
Adversaries with knowledge of Microsoft Azure services might interact with Purview via native APIs to perform malicious activities. By using available APIs, attackers can gather intelligence on Purview configurations, ascertain the sensitivity classification of datasets, or automate data exfiltration processes, all while remaining within the bounds of permitted operations to evade detection.

### T1496 - Resource Hijacking
Resource hijacking could occur if attackers gain access to Microsoft Purviewâ€™s underlying infrastructure to exploit its resources for their own purposes, such as cryptocurrency mining. This misuse of service resources could lead to performance degradation and unauthorized costs and potentially open new vectors for further network penetration.

### T1505 - Server Software Component
Attackers may look to install or manipulate server software components within Microsoft Purview to establish a persistent presence or to further compromise the system. By adding malicious components or altering existing ones, adversaries could modify the functionality of Purview, potentially leading to data leaks or service disruptions.

### T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application
If Microsoft Purview's external interfaces are not properly secured, attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. This exploitation could provide initial access to the environment or elevate privileges within Purview, leading to data breaches or unauthorized changes to data governance protocols.
