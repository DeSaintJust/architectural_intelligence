**Initial Access - Valid Accounts (T1078)**
Threat actors may attempt to gain initial access to Microsoft Sentinel by compromising valid user credentials. This could involve phishing attacks or brute-force attempts to harvest credentials for legitimate user or service accounts that have access to Sentinel, enabling unauthorized entry into the environment.

**Execution - PowerShell (T1059.001)**
Given Sentinel's deep integration with Azure and other Microsoft services, attackers might leverage PowerShell for malicious activities against the infrastructure hosting Sentinel. They might execute scripts to manipulate data ingestion processes or alter rules and alerts within the dashboard.

**Persistence - Account Manipulation (T1098)**
Once attackers gain access, they might create new accounts or modify existing ones to maintain persistence within Microsoft Sentinel. This involves modifying account permissions to ensure continued access to monitor or manipulate alerts and configurations without detection.

**Privilege Escalation - Application Layer Protocol (T1573.001)**
Attackers might use manipulation of application layer protocols to escalate privileges. By interacting with APIs of Azure or Sentinel, adversaries can attempt to escalate privileges in the application layer to alter alerting mechanisms or create blind spots within logging.

**Defense Evasion - Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)**
Threat actors could use obfuscation techniques to hide their traces, including obfuscating scripts or file loads in logs analyzed by Sentinel. This might hinder the ability of Sentinel to detect malicious scripts when performing log analysis or threat hunting.

**Credential Access - Unsecured Credentials (T1552)**
Threat actors might scout for unsecured credentials stored in configuration files or scripts that have access to Sentinel or associated cloud resources. These credentials can be exploited to gain access or manipulate scenes in a Sentinel deployment.

**Discovery - Cloud Service Discovery (T1580)**
Adversaries might query Azure APIs to discover various cloud services in use, including how Sentinel is deployed. Gaining this information allows attackers to understand the architecture and potentially plan their activities to evade detection or target specific services for disruption.

**Lateral Movement - Remote Services (T1021)**
Compromised credentials or exploited vulnerabilities in associated Azure services could facilitate lateral movement. Attackers might utilize remote services accessible through Sentinelâ€™s integration, aiming to spread into other cloud accounts or move within the infrastructure.

**Collection - Data from Network Shared Drive (T1039)**
If Sentinel interacts with shared drives or data repositories, attackers can leverage misconfigurations to collect sensitive logs or data that can provide insights into security measures and potential weaknesses.

**Impact - Data Manipulation (T1565)**
Attackers gaining control over Sentinel might purposefully manipulate data streams or logs integrated into the SIEM, creating false data or suppressing alerts related to ongoing attacks. This can significantly degrade Sentinel's monitoring capabilities and overall reliability.
