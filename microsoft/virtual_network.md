### External Remote Services (T1133)

Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) are susceptible to external remote services threats, which involve attackers trying to exploit an organization's resources by accessing them through public endpoints exposed on the Internet. Attackers can leverage IP scanning tools to identify open ports and use brute force techniques or stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to services such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell (SSH) that are running within the VNet. Ensuring that only necessary ports are open and implementing network security groups (NSGs) can help mitigate these risks.

### Lateral Movement via Virtual Private Network (VPN) (T1021.001)

After gaining initial access to an Azure environment, adversaries may attempt lateral movement through VPN connections established within the Azure VNets. These VPNs can be exploited if they are not properly secured or if inadequate logging and monitoring are in place. Attackers may move laterally to other resources in the environment by utilizing VPN connections that have insufficient segmentation or lack proper network security. Implementing strict network segmentation policies and routinely auditing VPN access can reduce the risk of lateral movement.

### DNS Tunneling (T1572)

Azure VNets can be targeted using DNS tunneling, a technique where attackers encode data within DNS queries and responses to communicate with an external command and control server. This type of attack takes advantage of DNS traffic's typically unmonitored nature as a means of data exfiltration or command and control. Defending against this threat necessitates employing DNS filtering services that can identify and block suspicious patterns and analyzing DNS traffic for anomalies.

### Credential Dumping (T1003)

Credential dumping in Azure VNets can occur when attackers extract credentials from memory, OS files, or other sources within the virtual machines or applications deployed in the network. This technique is particularly dangerous as it can provide attackers with the access they need to escalate privileges or further infiltrate an organization's Azure resources. Utilization of Azure's built-in security tools such as Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) and ensuring that endpoints within the VNet follow best practices for security can help defend against this threat.

### Man-in-the-Middle (T1557)

Within Azure VNets, man-in-the-middle attacks can manifest when an adversary intercepts communications between clients and servers. This can be accomplished through various means, such as spoofing network elements or redirecting traffic. Attackers can then capture sensitive data or manipulate communications to further exploit the network. Implementing strong encryption protocols such as TLS and utilizing Azure's network security mechanisms like NSGs and Application Gateway for secure communication help mitigate the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Data Exfiltration via Automated Transfer (T1020)

Data exfiltration poses a significant threat to Azure VNets, especially when attackers leverage automated scripts or tools to transfer data from within the network to an external location. This could involve using common protocols or services that are implicitly trusted, such as HTTP or HTTPS, to mask the malicious activity under normal operations. Monitoring outbound traffic and implementing data loss prevention (DLP) solutions are necessary to detect and prevent unauthorized data transfers from VNets.

### Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105)

Threat actors may transfer malicious tools into Azure VNets once they have established a foothold in the network. This could involve downloading malware payloads or utility software that aids in further exploitation or persistence within the network. Such actions can be hidden within legitimate network traffic, making them challenging to detect. Continuous monitoring and employing Azure-native security features like Microsoft Defender for Cloud can alert on and prevent unauthorized tool transfers.

### Service Stop (T1489)

Attackers may attempt to disrupt operations in Azure VNets by stopping critical services, causing significant downtime or loss of availability for applications hosted within the network. This can be achieved by leveraging elevated privileges to shut down critical services or altering configurations. Implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) and regularly auditing service permissions can help defend against such disruptions by ensuring that only authorized users can perform administrative actions.

### Privilege Escalation through Configuration Changes (T1068)

In the Azure VNet context, adversaries may exploit configuration errors or vulnerabilities to escalate their privileges within the network, gaining higher-level access to resources. This threat can arise from misconfigured network security groups, identity and access management (IAM) policies, or software vulnerabilities within running applications. Regular configuration reviews, vulnerability assessments, and robust change management processes are critical in preventing privilege escalation attacks.
