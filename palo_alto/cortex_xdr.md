## Initial Access: Drive-by Compromise (T1189)
Cortex XDR could be exposed to drive-by compromise attacks if the endpoint protection sensors fail to detect or block malicious web pages. An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in a web browser or plug-in, allowing them to install a malicious payload without user interaction. This initial foothold could then be used to bypass or disable endpoint detection capabilities.

## Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)
Adversaries might utilize command and scripting interpreters like PowerShell, bash, or cmd to execute scripts and commands directly on the endpoint managed by Cortex XDR. This technique can be used to script payloads and execute commands that could evade detection by leveraging built-in system interpreters that are often considered trusted binary files.

## Persistence: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547)
Threat actors may achieve persistence by employing boot or logon autostart techniques, such as editing the Windows Registry or setting up startup scripts to run malicious code automatically when the system boots or a user logs in. Detection for such modifications might be circumvented if Cortex XDR policies are not tuned to trigger on these specific changes.

## Privilege Escalation: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068)
Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system or applications running on an endpoint to escalate privileges. By running code with elevated rights, adversaries can disable security tools and potentially manipulate Cortex XDR's configurations, rendering it ineffective.

## Defense Evasion: Masquerading (T1036)
Masquerading techniques allow an adversary to disguise malicious activities to look benign, often by renaming files or using legitimate processes. By making malicious files appear to be legitimate ones, attackers may bypass detection mechanisms. Cortex XDR must be configured properly to detect such anomalies in expected file names and paths.

## Credential Access: OS Credential Dumping (T1003)
Cortex XDR-protected endpoints might be targeted for credential dumping, where attackers extract stored passwords and hashes from the operating system. This can be achieved via tools like Mimikatz, targeting LSASS process memory or accessing SAM databases. Once credentials are stolen, they can be reused to gain unauthorized access to additional systems and data.

## Discovery: Network Service Scanning (T1046)
Adversaries perform network service scanning to identify open ports and services on hosts. Successful detection of weaknesses can enable lateral movement or further exploitation. While Cortex XDR provides visibility, it may require additional network-level telemetry to fully detect and understand the extent of an internal reconnaissance operation.

## Lateral Movement: Remote Service Execution (T1021)
Remote service execution allows threat actors to move laterally within a network by executing code on remote systems through services like PsExec, RDP, and SSH. Without robust monitoring and anomaly detection settings in Cortex XDR, these movements can go unnoticed, especially if using legitimate credentials.

## Collection: Data from Information Repositories (T1213)
Attackers may target information repositories such as databases or file shares to collect valuable data. Despite Cortex XDRâ€™s capabilities to monitor endpoint activities, unauthorized access to repositories may require additional data governance and access control solutions for full protection and visibility.

## Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)
Exfiltrating data over a command-and-control channel can allow attackers to bypass typical network monitoring. By disguising exfiltration as regular C2 traffic, attackers can move sensitive information out of the network. Cortex XDR must be complemented with network traffic analysis tools to detect such traffic anomalies effectively.

## Impact: Data Destruction (T1485)
Data destruction techniques involve deleting or corrupting data to disrupt business operations. Attackers could leverage elevated privileges obtained on endpoints protected by Cortex XDR to execute scripts or use tools that cause irrecoverable data loss. Preventing such impacts requires prompt detection and response capabilities integrated within Cortex XDR.
