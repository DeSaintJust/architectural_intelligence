**Initial Access - Phishing (T1566):** Palo Alto Panorama may be targeted through phishing campaigns that aim to deceive users into disclosing their login credentials or downloading malware. Attackers might craft convincing emails that appear to originate from trusted internal sources or external partners, which contain malicious links or attachments designed to compromise the system when accessed.

---

**Execution - Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059):** Once attackers gain access to the system, they might utilize scripting interpreters such as PowerShell or Python to execute malicious code. These scripts can be used to perform a variety of harmful operations including establishing persistence, escalating privileges, and facilitating lateral movement throughout the network.

---

**Persistence - Create Account (T1136):** To maintain their foothold within the Panorama environment, adversaries may create new, unauthorized user accounts. These accounts can be leveraged for ongoing access to the system without immediately alerting administrators to their presence, especially if established with elevated privileges.

---

**Privilege Escalation - Valid Accounts (T1078):** By obtaining legitimate user credentials through various methods such as password spraying or credential stuffing, attackers could escalate their privileges within the Panorama. With elevated access, they can change configurations, disable security measures, or access sensitive logs and network data.

---

**Defense Evasion - Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027):** Attackers may obfuscate malicious payloads or scripts to evade detection by security tools employed within the Panorama system. Techniques such as encoding, encryption, or compression can be used to disguise the nature of the content until it is executed in the target environment.

---

**Credential Access - Brute Force (T1110):** Adversaries may attempt to gain unauthorized access through brute force attacks on Panorama accounts. By systematically trying multiple password combinations, they seek to uncover valid login credentials that grant them access to the system’s management interface.

---

**Discovery - Network Service Discovery (T1046):** Attackers with access to Panorama might perform network reconnaissance to identify active services and potential targets within the network. This can involve mapping out the topology, understanding firewall rules, and identifying management interfaces for further exploration or exploitation.

---

**Lateral Movement - Remote Services (T1021):** Once inside the network, attackers might use remote services such as SSH or RDP to move laterally across the organization's infrastructure. Panorama's role as a centralized management console makes it a valuable platform for attackers to pivot and expand their reach.

---

**Collection - Data from Local System (T1005):** Malicious actors may collect sensitive data from Panorama’s local environment, focusing on configuration files, logs, and detailed security policies. This information can be used to better understand the network’s defenses or prepare for future attacks.

---

**Exfiltration - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041):** Adversaries might use covert channels established with the Panorama system to exfiltrate data back to their command and control servers. This commonly involves encrypting data and disguising it as legitimate traffic to avoid detection by data loss prevention tools.

---

**Impact - Data Manipulation (T1565):** Rearranging or modifying firewall rules and policies within Panorama can lead to data manipulation attacks that affect how traffic is filtered or logged. Such changes can degrade security postures or create blindspots, enabling further undetected activities within the network.
