### Initial Access: Phishing [T1566]
Phishing attacks remain a predominant initial access vector in cloud environments. Threat actors may target individuals with access to Strata Cloud Manager by delivering phishing emails designed to trick recipients into compromising credentials or executing malicious payloads. These emails can impersonate trusted organizations or internal communication to bypass standard mail filters and exploit user trust.

### Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter [T1059]
Once access is obtained, adversaries may leverage command and scripting interpreters to execute arbitrary code within the environment. Techniques such as PowerShell, Python, or Bash scripts could be used to automate further malicious activities, such as data exfiltration or lateral movement, making it crucial to monitor for unusual script execution patterns.

### Persistence: Cloud Account [T1078.004]
Threat actors may seek to maintain persistent access by compromising legitimate cloud accounts or creating new accounts with high privileges. This sub-technique allows attackers to bypass detection by blending in with normal user activity while maintaining a foothold in the environment, emphasizing the need for strict IAM policies and vigilant monitoring.

### Privilege Escalation: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation [T1068]
Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the Strata Cloud Manager or connected systems can allow adversaries to escalate privileges. This may include leveraging software bugs to gain unauthorized control or manipulate existing permissions, thus expanding their impact and control over cloud resources.

### Defense Evasion: Credential Dumping [T1003]
Credential dumping allows attackers to extract credentials from memory, cache, or user profiles. In cloud settings, this could facilitate unauthorized access to additional services or data, bypassing authentication mechanisms. Administrators should enforce password policies and utilize multi-factor authentication to mitigate these risks.

### Credential Access: Brute Force [T1110]
Brute force techniques target authentication mechanisms, attempting numerous password combinations to gain access. This is particularly concerning for public cloud infrastructures where interfaces may be exposed to the internet. Password complexity requirements and account lockout policies can help defend against these attacks.

### Discovery: Cloud Service Discovery [T1580]
Upon gaining access, adversaries may perform discovery actions to identify available cloud services within the Strata Cloud Manager. Understanding these resources allows attackers to plan further exploits or data exfiltration. Logging and alerting on unusual API calls or scan-like behavior can aid in early detection.

### Lateral Movement: Internal Spearphishing [T1534]
Internal spearphishing involves conducting tailored phishing campaigns within an organization once initial access is established. Attackers might leverage compromised accounts to send malicious links or attachments, aiming to capture additional credentials or deploy malware, emphasizing the need for user awareness training and email filtering.

### Collection: Data from Cloud Storage Object [T1567.002]
Threat actors may target and collect sensitive data from cloud storage objects managed by Strata Cloud Manager. They might use misconfigured permissions or exploitation of vulnerabilities to access this data, making it critical to implement least privilege access controls and regular security assessments.

### Exfiltration: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage [T1567.001]
Exfiltration to cloud storage involves transferring data to an external location under attacker control. This could be conducted via automated scripts or manual actions, often utilizing legitimate cloud services for cover. Monitoring data transfer sizes, destination IPs, and patterns can help detect and mitigate such activities.
